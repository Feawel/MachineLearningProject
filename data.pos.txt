18959 | 0.94444 | If no one singles out any of these performances as award-worthy , it 's only because we would expect nothing less from this bunch .
18963 | 0.93056 | If you 're like me , a sucker for a good old fashion romance and someone who shamelessly loves to eat , then Mostly Martha offers all the perfect ingredients to more than satisfy your appetite .

18995 | 0.72222 | It 's not so much enjoyable to watch as it is enlightening to listen to new sides of a previous reality , and to visit with some of the people who were able to make an impact in the theater world .
18996 | 0.81944 | It 's one of the saddest films I have ever seen that still manages to be uplifting but not overly sentimental .

19000 | 0.69444 | It 's still worth a look .
19002 | 0.875 | It could change America , not only because it is full of necessary discussion points , but because it is so accessible that it makes complex politics understandable to viewers looking for nothing but energetic entertainment .

19161 | 0.97222 | One of the greatest romantic comedies of the past decade .
19165 | 0.58333 | Over-the-top and a bit ostentatious , this is a movie that 's got oodles of style and substance .

19293 | 0.69444 | The Transporter is as lively and as fun as it is unapologetically dumb
19303 | 0.81944 | The director , Steven Shainberg , has succeeded by focusing intently on his characters , making them quirky individuals rather than figures of fun .
19306 | 0.69444 | The diversity of the artists represented , both in terms of style and ethnicity , prevents the proceedings from feeling repetitious , as does the appropriately brief 40-minute running time .
19309 | 0.81944 | The film 's greatest asset is how much it 's not just another connect-the-dots , spy-on-the-run picture .
19311 | 0.86111 | The film has just enough of everything -- re-enactments , archival footage , talking-head interviews -- and the music is simply sublime .
19313 | 0.88889 | The kooky yet shadowy vision Clooney sustains throughout is daring , inventive and impressive .

19342 | 0.66667 | The tug of war that ensues is as much a snapshot of modern China in microcosm as it is a crash course in movie mythology .
19345 | 0.875 | The unique tug-of-war with viewer expectations is undeniable , if not a pleasure in its own right .
19347 | 0.77778 | The whole cast looks to be having so much fun with the slapstick antics and silly street patois , tossing around obscure expressions like Bellini and Mullinski , that the compact 86 minutes breezes by .

25648 | 0.58333 | If The Count of Monte Cristo does n't transform Caviezel into a movie star , then the game is even more rigged than it was two centuries ago .
25652 | 0.86111 | If it seems like a minor miracle that its septuagenarian star is young enough to be the nonagenarian filmmaker 's son , more incredible still are the clear-eyed boldness and quiet irony with which actor and director take on life 's urgent questions .
25655 | 0.72917 | If it tried to do anything more , it would fail and perhaps explode , but at this level of manic whimsy , it is just about right .
25659 | 0.55556 | If the message seems more facile than the earlier films , the images have such a terrible beauty you may not care .
25663 | 0.70833 | If you can stomach the rough content , it 's worth checking out for the performances alone .

25679 | 0.875 | In his debut as a film director , Denzel Washington delivers a lean and engaging work .
25681 | 0.55556 | In spite of Good Housekeeping 's unsavory characters and WWF mentality , this white trash War of the Roses is a surprisingly engaging film .
25689 | 0.75 | Inside the film 's conflict-powered plot there is a decent moral trying to get out , but it 's not that , it 's the tension that keeps you in your seat .
25695 | 0.72222 | Instead of a hyperbolic beat-charged urban western , it 's an unpretentious , sociologically pointed slice of life .
25699 | 0.70833 | Interacting eyeball-to-eyeball and toe-to-toe , Hopkins and Norton are a winning combination -- but Fiennes steals ` Red Dragon ' right from under their noses .

25721 | 0.80556 | It 's a beautifully accomplished lyrical meditation on a bunch of despondent and vulnerable characters living in the renown Chelsea Hotel ...
25722 | 0.61111 | It 's a bittersweet and lyrical mix of elements .
25723 | 0.81944 | It 's a brave attempt to tap into the heartbeat of the world , a salute to the universal language of rhythm and a zippy sampling of sounds .

25730 | 0.79167 | It 's a lovely film with lovely performances by Buy and Accorsi .
25732 | 0.75 | It 's a much more emotional journey than what Shyamalan has given us in his past two movies , and Gibson , stepping in for Bruce Willis , is the perfect actor to take us on the trip .
25733 | 0.73611 | It 's a nicely detailed world of pawns , bishops and kings , of wagers in dingy backrooms or pristine forests .

25735 | 0.77778 | It 's a refreshing change from the self-interest and paranoia that shape most American representations of Castro .
25736 | 0.83333 | It 's a remarkably solid and subtly satirical tour de force .
25737 | 0.76389 | It 's a stunning lyrical work of considerable force and truth .
25738 | 0.77778 | It 's absolutely spooky how Lillard channels the Shagster right down to the original Casey Kasem-furnished voice .
25739 | 0.81944 | It 's also , clearly , great fun .
25741 | 0.70833 | It 's an example of sophisticated , challenging filmmaking that stands , despite its noticeable lack of emotional heft , in welcome contrast to the indulgent dead-end experimentation of the director 's previous Full Frontal .

25790 | 0.70833 | It is far from the worst , thanks to the topical issues it raises , the performances of Stewart and Hardy , and that essential feature -- a decent full-on space battle .

25798 | 0.81944 | It never fails to engage us .
25799 | 0.73611 | It provides an honest look at a community striving to anchor itself in new grounds .
25800 | 0.90278 | It provides the grand , intelligent entertainment of a superior cast playing smart people amid a compelling plot .
25802 | 0.61111 | It suggests the wide-ranging effects of media manipulation , from the kind of reporting that is done by the supposedly liberal media ... to the intimate and ultimately tragic heartache of maverick individuals like Hatfield and Hicks .
25803 | 0.66667 | It takes this never-ending confusion and hatred , puts a human face on it , evokes shame among all who are party to it and even promotes understanding .
25805 | 0.83333 | It turns out to be a cut above the norm , thanks to some clever writing and sprightly acting .
25812 | 0.63889 | Its direction , its script , and Weaver 's performance as a vaguely discontented woman of substance make for a mildly entertaining 77 minutes , if that 's what you 're in the mood for .
25829 | 0.72222 | Jagger the actor is someone you want to see again .
25842 | 0.68056 | Japan 's premier stylist of sex and blood hits audiences with what may be his most demented film to date .

25920 | 0.79167 | LaPaglia 's ability to convey grief and hope works with Weaver 's sensitive reactions to make this a two-actor master class .
25927 | 0.83333 | Lathan and Diggs have considerable personal charm , and their screen rapport makes the old story seem new .
25931 | 0.83333 | Lauren Ambrose comes alive under the attention from two strangers in town - with honest performances and realistic interaction between the characters , this is a coming-of-age story with a twist .
25936 | 0.91667 | Leave it to Rohmer , now 82 , to find a way to bend current technique to the service of a vision of the past that is faithful to both architectural glories and commanding open spaces of the city as it was more than two centuries ago .

25986 | 0.72222 | Like old myths and wonder tales spun afresh .
26003 | 0.73611 | Look , this is a terrific flick replete with dazzling camera-work , dancing and music .
26026 | 0.75 | Maguire is a surprisingly effective Peter\/Spider-Man .
26030 | 0.65278 | Majidi 's poetic love story is a ravishing consciousness-raiser , if a bit draggy at times .
26031 | 0.76389 | Majidi gets uniformly engaging performances from his largely amateur cast .
26035 | 0.84722 | Makes S&M seem very romantic , and Maggie Gyllenhaal is a delight .

26106 | 0.66667 | More honest about Alzheimer 's disease , I think , than Iris .
26108 | 0.66667 | More than makes up for its mawkish posing by offering rousing spates of genuine feeling .
26125 | 0.84722 | Much monkeyfun for all .
26139 | 0.83333 | My oh my , is this an invigorating , electric movie .
26171 | 0.72222 | Neither Parker nor Donovan is a typical romantic lead , but they bring a fresh , quirky charm to the formula .
26176 | 0.65278 | Nervy and sensitive , it taps into genuine artistic befuddlement , and at the same time presents a scathing indictment of what drives Hollywood .
26190 | 0.88889 | Nicolas Philibert observes life inside a one-room schoolhouse in northern France in his documentary To Be and to Have , easily one of the best films of the year .
26194 | 0.83333 | Nine Queens is not only than a frighteningly capable debut and genre piece , but also a snapshot of a dangerous political situation on the verge of coming to a head .
26203 | 0.90278 | No sophomore slump for director Sam Mendes , who segues from Oscar winner to Oscar-winning potential with a smooth sleight of hand .

26210 | 0.73611 | Not a bad journey at all .
26213 | 0.72222 | Not a cozy or ingratiating work , but it 's challenging , sometimes clever , and always interesting , and those are reasons enough to see it .
26222 | 0.76389 | Not everything works , but the average is higher than in Mary and most other recent comedies .
26225 | 0.61111 | Not far beneath the surface , this reconfigured tale asks disturbing questions about those things we expect from military epics .
26229 | 0.81944 | Not only is Undercover Brother as funny , if not more so , than both Austin Powers films , but it 's also one of the smarter , savvier spoofs to come along in some time .
26235 | 0.77778 | Not too far below the gloss you can still feel director Denis Villeneuve 's beating heart and the fondness he has for his characters .
26237 | 0.69444 | Nothing 's at stake , just a twisty double-cross you can smell a mile away -- still , the derivative Nine Queens is lots of fun .

26250 | 0.61111 | Noyce 's film is contemplative and mournfully reflective .
26252 | 0.52778 | Noyce films it more as a shocking history lesson than as drama .

26302 | 0.78125 | One scarcely needs the subtitles to enjoy this colorful action farce .
26306 | 0.94444 | Only an epic documentary could get it all down , and Spike Lee 's Jim Brown : All American at long last gives its subject a movie worthy of his talents .

26442 | 0.72222 | Reign of Fire looks as if it was made without much thought -- and is best watched that way .
26444 | 0.69444 | Reign of Fire may be little more than another platter of reheated Aliens , but it 's still pretty tasty .
26447 | 0.65278 | Reinforces the often forgotten fact of the world 's remarkably varying human population and mindset , and its capacity to heal using creative , natural and ancient antidotes .

26457 | 0.83333 | Resourceful and ingenious entertainment .

26598 | 0.61111 | Smith 's approach is never to tease , except gently and in that way that makes us consider our own eccentricities and how they are expressed through our homes .
26601 | 0.84722 | Smith 's point is simple and obvious -- people 's homes are extensions of themselves , and particularly eccentric people have particularly eccentric living spaces -- but his subjects are charmers .
26603 | 0.73958 | Smith profiles five extraordinary American homes , and because the owners seem fully aware of the uses and abuses of fame , it 's a pleasure to enjoy their eccentricities .
26606 | 0.79167 | So many documentaries like this presuppose religious bigotry or zealous nuttiness of its antagonists , but Family Fundamentals displays a rare gift for unflinching impartiality .
26608 | 0.66667 | So refreshingly incisive is Grant that for the first time he 'll probably appeal more to guys than to their girlfriends who drag them to this movie for the Hugh factor .
26609 | 0.73611 | So unassuming and pure of heart , you ca n't help but warmly extend your arms and yell ` Safe ! '
26613 | 0.79167 | Some movies are like a tasty hors-d'oeuvre ; this one is a feast .

26705 | 0.84722 | That rara avis : the intelligent romantic comedy with actual ideas on its mind .
26707 | 0.90278 | The 3D images only enhance the film 's otherworldly quality , giving it a strange combo of you-are-there closeness with the disorienting unreality of the seemingly broken-down fourth wall of the movie screen .
26710 | 0.56944 | The AM-radio soundtrack and game cast -- Tierney and the inimitable Walken especially -- keep this unusual comedy from choking on its own conceit .
26712 | 0.79167 | The Bourne Identity is what summer screen escapism used to be in the decades when it was geared more to grownups .

26749 | 0.86111 | The WWII drama is well plotted , visually striking and filled with enjoyably complex characters who are never what they first appear .
26753 | 0.90278 | The acting , costumes , music , cinematography and sound are all astounding given the production 's austere locales .
26754 | 0.91667 | The acting alone is worth the price of admission .
26757 | 0.55556 | The actors are so terrific at conveying their young angst , we do indeed feel for them .
26766 | 0.83333 | The best film about baseball to hit theaters since Field of Dreams .
26768 | 0.73611 | The best revenge may just be living well because this film , unlike other Dumas adaptations , is far more likened to a treasure than a lengthy jail sentence .
26771 | 0.76389 | The best thing the film does is to show us not only what that mind looks like , but how the creative process itself operates .

65937 | 0.77778 | Hashiguchi vividly captures the way young Japanese live now , chafing against their culture 's manic mix of millennial brusqueness and undying , traditional politesse .
65942 | 0.68056 | Hatfield and Hicks make the oddest of couples , and in this sense the movie becomes a study of the gambles of the publishing world , offering a case study that exists apart from all the movie 's political ramifications .
65944 | 0.75 | Hatosy ... portrays young Brendan with his usual intelligence and subtlety , not to mention a convincing brogue .

66043 | 0.84722 | Holofcener rejects patent solutions to dramatize life 's messiness from inside out , in all its strange quirks .
66056 | 0.66667 | Horns and Halos benefits from serendipity but also reminds us of our own responsibility to question what is told as the truth .
66064 | 0.66667 | How good this film might be , depends if you believe that the shocking conclusion is too much of a plunge or not .
66072 | 0.94444 | Hugely entertaining from start to finish , featuring a fall from grace that still leaves shockwaves , it will gratify anyone who has ever suspected Hollywood of being overrun by corrupt and hedonistic weasels .
66084 | 0.93056 | Huppert and Girardot give performances of exceptional honesty .
66090 | 0.75 | I 'd be lying if I said my ribcage did n't ache by the end of Kung Pow .
66094 | 0.83333 | I 'd watch these two together again in a New York minute .
66102 | 0.55556 | I 'll put it this way : If you 're in the mood for a melodrama narrated by talking fish , this is the movie for you .
66119 | 0.79167 | I 'm sure mainstream audiences will be baffled , but , for those with at least a minimal appreciation of Woolf and Clarissa Dalloway , The Hours represents two of those well spent .
66126 | 0.81944 | I 've never seen or heard anything quite like this film , and I recommend it for its originality alone .
66128 | 0.73611 | I admire the closing scenes of the film , which seem to ask whether our civilization offers a cure for Vincent 's complaint .
66130 | 0.80556 | I am highly amused by the idea that we have come to a point in society where it has been deemed important enough to make a film in which someone has to be hired to portray Richard Dawson .
66137 | 0.65278 | I could n't recommend this film more .
66139 | 0.72222 | I do n't feel the least bit ashamed in admitting that my enjoyment came at the expense of seeing justice served , even if it 's a dish that 's best served cold .
66144 | 0.66667 | I do n't know if Frailty will turn Bill Paxton into an A-list director , but he can rest contentedly with the knowledge that he 's made at least one damn fine horror movie .
66155 | 0.59722 | I found myself liking the film , though in this case one man 's treasure could prove to be another man 's garbage .
66157 | 0.88889 | I had more fun watching Spy than I had with most of the big summer movies .
66163 | 0.72222 | I have always appreciated a smartly written motion picture , and , whatever flaws Igby Goes Down may possess , it is undeniably that .
66166 | 0.93056 | I have n't laughed that hard in years !
66170 | 0.88889 | I hope the movie is widely seen and debated with appropriate ferocity and thoughtfulness .

66205 | 0.77778 | I simply ca n't recommend it enough .
66212 | 0.625 | I was impressed by how many tit-for-tat retaliatory responses the filmmakers allow before pulling the plug on the conspirators and averting an American-Russian Armageddon .
66223 | 0.625 | Ian Holm conquers France as an earthy Napoleon
66240 | 0.63889 | If Mostly Martha is mostly unsurprising , it 's still a sweet , even delectable diversion .
66242 | 0.54167 | If Reno is to the left of liberal on the political spectrum , her tough , funny , rather chaotic show is n't subversive so much as it is nit-picky about the hypocrisies of our time .
66244 | 0.65278 | If a big musical number like ` Praise the Lord , He 's the God of Second Chances ' does n't put you off , this will be an enjoyable choice for younger kids .
66246 | 0.88889 | If a horror movie 's primary goal is to frighten and disturb , then They works spectacularly well ... A shiver-inducing , nerve-rattling ride .
66248 | 0.83333 | If anything , the film is doing something of a public service -- shedding light on a group of extremely talented musicians who might otherwise go unnoticed and underappreciated by music fans .
66250 | 0.75 | If cinema had been around to capture the chaos of France in the 1790 's , one imagines the result would look like something like this .
66252 | 0.56944 | If horses could fly , this is surely what they 'd look like .
66256 | 0.65278 | If the film fails to fulfill its own ambitious goals , it nonetheless sustains interest during the long build-up of expository material .
66261 | 0.75 | If the film has a problem , its shortness disappoints : You want the story to go on and on .
66263 | 0.58333 | If there 's one big point to Promises , it 's that nothing can change while physical and psychological barriers keep the sides from speaking even one word to each other .
66265 | 0.55556 | If this movie leaves you cool , it also leaves you intriguingly contemplative .

66271 | 0.66667 | If you 're content with a clever pseudo-bio that manages to have a good time as it doles out pieces of the famous director 's life , Eisenstein delivers .
66275 | 0.61111 | If you 're looking for a smart , nuanced look at de Sade and what might have happened at Picpus , Sade is your film .
66286 | 0.80556 | If you can get past the taboo subject matter , it will be well worth your time .

66316 | 0.86111 | If you love the music , and I do , its hard to imagine having more fun watching a documentary ...
66320 | 0.51389 | Igby Goes Down is one of those movies .
66324 | 0.61111 | Imamura has said that Warm Water Under a Red Bridge is a poem to the enduring strengths of women .
66332 | 0.79167 | Implicitly acknowledges and celebrates the glorious chicanery and self-delusion of this most American of businesses , and for that reason it may be the most oddly honest Hollywood document of all .
66335 | 0.80556 | Impossible as it may sound , this film 's heart is even more embracing than Monty , if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition .
66337 | 0.875 | Impresses as a skillfully assembled , highly polished and professional adaptation ... just about as chilling and unsettling as ` Manhunter ' was .
66339 | 0.66667 | In Auteil 's less dramatic but equally incisive performance , he 's a charismatic charmer likely to seduce and conquer .
66343 | 0.81944 | In XXX , Diesel is that rare creature -- an action hero with table manners , and one who proves that elegance is more than tattoo deep .
66345 | 0.69444 | In a movie full of surprises , the biggest is that Secret Ballot is a comedy , both gentle and biting .
66347 | 0.81944 | In a summer of clones , Harvard Man is something rare and riveting : a wild ride that relies on more than special effects .
66349 | 0.88889 | In a summer overrun with movies dominated by CGI aliens and super heroes , it revigorates the mind to see a feature that concentrates on people , a project in which the script and characters hold sway .
66352 | 0.94444 | In addition to gluing you to the edge of your seat , Changing Lanes is also a film of freshness , imagination and insight .
66363 | 0.79167 | In its treatment of the dehumanizing and ego-destroying process of unemployment , Time Out offers an exploration that is more accurate than anything I have seen in an American film .
66365 | 0.66667 | In its understanding , often funny way , it tells a story whose restatement is validated by the changing composition of the nation .
66367 | 0.56944 | In many ways , reminiscent of 1992 's Unforgiven which also utilized the scintillating force of its actors to draw out the menace of its sparse dialogue .
66371 | 0.75 | In painting an unabashedly romantic picture of a nation whose songs spring directly from the lives of the people , the movie exalts the Marxian dream of honest working folk , with little to show for their labor , living harmoniously , joined in song .
66373 | 0.70833 | In questioning the election process , Payami graphically illustrates the problems of fledgling democracies , but also the strength and sense of freedom the Iranian people already possess , with or without access to the ballot box .
66378 | 0.65278 | In the affable Maid in Manhattan , Jennifer Lopez 's most aggressive and most sincere attempt to take movies by storm , the diva shrewdly surrounds herself with a company of strictly A-list players .
66382 | 0.80556 | In the new release of Cinema Paradiso , the tale has turned from sweet to bittersweet , and when the tears come during that final , beautiful scene , they finally feel absolutely earned .
66395 | 0.72222 | Inherently caustic and oddly whimsical , the film chimes in on the grieving process and strangely draws the audience into the unexplainable pain and eccentricities that are attached to the concept of loss .
66397 | 0.95833 | Insanely hilarious !
66405 | 0.94444 | Insomnia is one of the year 's best films and Pacino gives one of his most daring , and complicated , performances .
66406 | 0.68056 | Instead , she sees it as a chance to revitalize what is and always has been remarkable about clung-to traditions .
66408 | 0.69444 | Instead of hitting the audience over the head with a moral , Schrader relies on subtle ironies and visual devices to convey point of view .
66412 | 0.77778 | Intelligent , caustic take on a great writer and dubious human being .
66415 | 0.73611 | Interesting both as a historical study and as a tragic love story .
66424 | 0.79167 | Inventive , fun , intoxicatingly sexy , violent , self-indulgent and maddening .
66429 | 0.91667 | Invigorating , surreal , and resonant with a rainbow of emotion .
66438 | 0.83333 | Irwin is so earnest that it 's hard to resist his pleas to spare wildlife and respect their environs .

66456 | 0.68056 | It 'll keep you wide awake and ... very tense .
66461 | 0.84722 | It 's Quaid who anchors the film with his effortless performance and that trademark grin of his -- so perfect for a ballplayer .
66467 | 0.90278 | It 's a beautiful film , full of elaborate and twisted characters - and it 's also pretty funny .
66472 | 0.88889 | It 's a compelling and horrifying story , and The Laramie Project is worthwhile for reminding us that this sort of thing does , in fact , still happen in America .
66474 | 0.91667 | It 's a fairy tale that comes from a renowned Indian film culture that allows Americans to finally revel in its splendor .
66475 | 0.77778 | It 's a familiar story , but one that is presented with great sympathy and intelligence .
66476 | 0.83333 | It 's a feel-good movie about which you can actually feel good .
66477 | 0.77778 | It 's a film that 's destined to win a wide summer audience through word-of-mouth reviews and , not far down the line , to find a place among the studio 's animated classics .
66478 | 0.83333 | It 's a fine , focused piece of work that reopens an interesting controversy and never succumbs to sensationalism .
66479 | 0.77778 | It 's a fine , old-fashioned-movie movie , which is to say it 's unburdened by pretensions to great artistic significance .
66482 | 0.98611 | It 's a head-turner -- thoughtfully written , beautifully read and , finally , deeply humanizing .
66483 | 0.81944 | It 's a hoot watching The Rock chomp on jumbo ants , pull an arrow out of his back , and leap unscathed through raging fire !
66484 | 0.81944 | It 's a lovely , eerie film that casts an odd , rapt spell .
66485 | 0.80556 | It 's a lovely , sad dance highlighted by Kwan 's unique directing style .
66487 | 0.73611 | It 's a movie that accomplishes so much that one viewing ca n't possibly be enough .
66488 | 0.84722 | It 's a perfect show of respect to just one of those underrated professionals who deserve but rarely receive it .
66489 | 0.68056 | It 's a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places , but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety .
66490 | 0.86111 | It 's a powerful though flawed movie , guaranteed to put a lump in your throat while reaffirming Washington as possibly the best actor working in movies today .
66491 | 0.70833 | It 's a ripper of a yarn and I for one enjoyed the thrill of the chill .
66497 | 0.63889 | It 's a setup so easy it borders on facile , but keeping the film from cheap-shot mediocrity is its crack cast .
66503 | 0.79167 | It 's a smart , funny look at an arcane area of popular culture , and if it is n't entirely persuasive , it does give exposure to some talented performers .
66505 | 0.86111 | It 's a smartly directed , grown-up film of ideas .
66506 | 0.66667 | It 's a solid movie about people whose lives are anything but .
66507 | 0.77778 | It 's a square , sentimental drama that satisfies , as comfort food often can .
66509 | 0.73611 | It 's a talking head documentary , but a great one .
66510 | 0.51389 | It 's a tour de force , written and directed so quietly that it 's implosion rather than explosion you fear .
66511 | 0.79167 | It 's a treat watching Shaw , a British stage icon , melting under the heat of Phocion 's attentions .
66512 | 0.68056 | It 's a visual delight and a decent popcorn adventure , as long as you do n't try to look too deep into the story
66513 | 0.93056 | It 's a wise and powerful tale of race and culture forcefully told , with superb performances throughout .
66514 | 0.90278 | It 's a wonderful , sobering , heart-felt drama .
66516 | 0.875 | It 's about individual moments of mood , and an aimlessness that 's actually sort of amazing .
66517 | 0.77778 | It 's affecting , amusing , sad and reflective .
66518 | 0.52778 | It 's all a rather shapeless good time ...
66519 | 0.83333 | It 's all about Anakin ... and the lustrous polished visuals rich in color and creativity and , of course , special effect .
66520 | 0.54167 | It 's all entertaining enough , but do n't look for any hefty anti-establishment message in what is essentially a whip-crack of a buddy movie that ends with a whimper .
66521 | 0.80556 | It 's all stitched together with energy , intelligence and verve , enhanced by a surplus of vintage archive footage .
66522 | 0.72222 | It 's always fascinating to watch Marker the essayist at work .
66524 | 0.63889 | It 's an ambitious film , and as with all ambitious films , it has some problems .
66528 | 0.77778 | It 's an experience in understanding a unique culture that is presented with universal appeal .
66535 | 0.875 | It 's anchored by splendid performances from an honored screen veteran and a sparkling newcomer who instantly transform themselves into a believable mother\/daughter pair .
66541 | 0.81944 | It 's as raw and action-packed an experience as a ringside seat at a tough-man contest .
66542 | 0.625 | It 's both degrading and strangely liberating to see people working so hard at leading lives of sexy intrigue , only to be revealed by the dispassionate Gantz brothers as ordinary , pasty lumpen .
66544 | 0.79167 | It 's bright , pristine style and bold colors make it as much fun as reading an oversized picture book before bedtime .
66545 | 0.77778 | It 's consistently funny , in an irresistible junior-high way , and consistently free of any gag that would force you to give it a millisecond of thought .
66549 | 0.84722 | It 's crafty , energetic and smart -- the kid is sort of like a fourteen-year old Ferris Bueller .
66550 | 0.70833 | It 's definitely an improvement on the first Blade , since it does n't take itself so deadly seriously .
66551 | 0.70833 | It 's fairly solid -- not to mention well edited so that it certainly does n't feel like a film that strays past the two and a half mark .
66553 | 0.61111 | It 's full of cheesy dialogue , but great trashy fun that finally returns De Palma to his pulpy thrillers of the early '80s .
66554 | 0.72222 | It 's fun , splashy and entertainingly nasty .
66555 | 0.77778 | It 's fun , wispy , wise and surprisingly inoffensive for a film about a teen in love with his stepmom .
66556 | 0.88889 | It 's funny , touching , dramatically forceful , and beautifully shot .
66557 | 0.77778 | It 's funny and human and really pretty damned wonderful , all at once .
66558 | 0.75 | It 's good to see Michael Caine whipping out the dirty words and punching people in the stomach again .
66567 | 0.81944 | It 's hard to imagine anyone managing to steal a movie not only from charismatic rising star Jake Gyllenhaal but also from accomplished Oscar winners Susan Sarandon , Dustin Hoffman and Holly Hunter , yet newcomer Ellen Pompeo pulls off the feat with aplomb .
66568 | 0.91667 | It 's immensely ambitious , different than anything that 's been done before and amazingly successful in terms of what it 's trying to do .
66577 | 0.73611 | It 's light on the chills and heavy on the atmospheric weirdness , and there are moments of jaw-droppingly odd behavior -- yet I found it weirdly appealing .
66581 | 0.73611 | It 's mildly entertaining , especially if you find comfort in familiarity .
66585 | 0.63889 | It 's mostly a pleasure to watch .
66589 | 0.83333 | It 's never dull and always looks good .
66590 | 0.80556 | It 's no accident that The Accidental Spy is a solid action pic that returns the martial arts master to top form .
66594 | 0.83333 | It 's no lie -- Big Fat Liar is a real charmer .
66595 | 0.83333 | It 's no surprise that as a director Washington demands and receives excellent performances , from himself and from newcomer Derek Luke .
66606 | 0.70833 | It 's not going to be everyone 's bag of popcorn , but it definitely gives you something to chew on .
66622 | 0.68056 | It 's not like having a real film of Nijinsky , but at least it 's better than that eponymous 1980 biopic that used soap in the places where the mysteries lingered .
66632 | 0.56944 | It 's packed to bursting with incident , and with scores of characters , some fictional , some from history .
66646 | 0.66667 | It 's pretty linear and only makeup-deep , but Bogdanovich ties it together with efficiency and an affection for the period .
66650 | 0.69444 | It 's rare for any movie to be as subtle and touching as The Son 's Room .
66651 | 0.73611 | It 's refreshing to see a romance this smart .
66652 | 0.76389 | It 's secondary to American Psycho but still has claws enough to get inside you and stay there for a couple of hours .
66653 | 0.97222 | It 's something of the ultimate Scorsese film , with all the stomach-turning violence , colorful New York gang lore and other hallmarks of his personal cinema painted on their largest-ever historical canvas .
66668 | 0.70833 | It 's still a comic book , but Maguire makes it a comic book with soul .
66669 | 0.75 | It 's stylishly directed with verve ...
66670 | 0.65278 | It 's surprisingly decent , particularly for a tenth installment in a series .
66671 | 0.88889 | It 's technically sumptuous but also almost wildly alive .
66672 | 0.86111 | It 's that good .
66673 | 0.875 | It 's that rare family movie -- genuine and sweet without relying on animation or dumb humor .
66674 | 0.83333 | It 's the brilliant surfing photography bringing you right inside the massive waves that lifts Blue Crush into one of the summer 's most pleasurable movies .
66675 | 0.77778 | It 's the cute frissons of discovery and humor between Chaplin and Kidman that keep this nicely wound clock not just ticking , but humming .
66683 | 0.72222 | It 's the type of film about growing up that we do n't see often enough these days : realistic , urgent , and not sugarcoated in the least .
66684 | 0.68056 | It 's truly awful and heartbreaking subject matter , but one whose lessons are well worth revisiting as many times as possible .
66690 | 0.73611 | It 's very Beavis and Butthead , yet always seems to elicit a chuckle .
66692 | 0.77778 | It 's weird , wonderful , and not necessarily for kids .
66697 | 0.66667 | It ai n't art , by a long shot , but unlike last year 's lame Musketeer , this Dumas adaptation entertains .
66698 | 0.73611 | It all plays out ... like a high-end John Hughes comedy , a kind of Elder Bueller 's Time Out .
66699 | 0.79167 | It asks nothing of the audience other than to sit back and enjoy a couple of great actors hamming it up .
66700 | 0.63889 | It cooks Conduct in a low , smoky and inviting sizzle .
66709 | 0.72222 | It establishes its ominous mood and tension swiftly , and if the suspense never rises to a higher level , it is nevertheless maintained throughout .
66710 | 0.70833 | It excels because , unlike so many other Hollywood movies of its ilk , it offers hope .
66711 | 0.68056 | It finds its moviegoing pleasures in the tiny events that could make a person who has lived her life half-asleep suddenly wake up and take notice .
66713 | 0.72222 | It gives devastating testimony to both people 's capacity for evil and their heroic capacity for good .
66714 | 0.68056 | It grabs you in the dark and shakes you vigorously for its duration .
66715 | 0.72222 | It has a caffeinated , sloppy brilliance , sparkling with ideas you wish had been developed with more care , but animated by an energy that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined grade-grubbers to shame .
66716 | 0.72222 | It has a way of seeping into your consciousness , with lingering questions about what the film is really getting at .
66719 | 0.80556 | It has that rare quality of being able to creep the living hell out of you ...
66726 | 0.70833 | It is OK for a movie to be something of a sitcom apparatus , if the lines work , the humor has point and the actors are humanly engaged .
66727 | 0.72222 | It is Scott 's convincing portrayal of Roger the sad cad that really gives the film its oomph .
66728 | 0.52778 | It is a challenging film , if not always a narratively cohesive one .

66782 | 0.75 | It was only a matter of time before some savvy producer saw the potential success inherent in the mixture of Bullock Bubble and Hugh Goo .
66783 | 0.63889 | It will make you think twice about what might be going on inside each trailer park you drive past -- even if it chiefly inspires you to drive a little faster .
66788 | 0.63889 | It wo n't hold up over the long haul , but in the moment , Finch 's tale provides the forgettable pleasures of a Saturday matinee .
66793 | 0.73611 | It works well enough , since the thrills pop up frequently , and the dispatching of the cast is as often imaginative as it is gory .
66795 | 0.84722 | It zips along with B-movie verve while adding the rich details and go-for-broke acting that heralds something special .

66975 | 0.76389 | K-19 : The Widowmaker is a great yarn .
66980 | 0.73611 | K-19 will not go down in the annals of cinema as one of the great submarine stories , but it is an engaging and exciting narrative of Man confronting the Demons of his own fear and paranoia .
66993 | 0.65278 | Katz 's documentary does n't have much panache , but with material this rich it does n't need it .
66998 | 0.56944 | Kaufman and Jonze take huge risks to ponder the whole notion of passion -- our desire as human beings for passion in our lives and the emptiness one feels when it is missing .

67080 | 0.91667 | Kudos to the most enchanting film of the year .
67092 | 0.66667 | Kwan is a master of shadow , quietude , and room noise , and Lan Yu is a disarmingly lived-in movie .

67175 | 0.76389 | Left me with the visceral sensation of longing , lasting traces of Charlotte 's web of desire and desperation .
67182 | 0.59722 | Leigh 's daring here is that without once denying the hardscrabble lives of people on the economic fringes of Margaret Thatcher 's ruinous legacy , he insists on the importance of those moments when people can connect and express their love for each other .
67184 | 0.75 | Leigh makes these lives count .
67188 | 0.75 | Leigh succeeds in delivering a dramatic slap in the face that 's simultaneously painful and refreshing .

67221 | 0.94444 | Light the candles , bring out the cake and do n't fret about the calories because there 's precious little substance in Birthday Girl -- it 's simply , and surprisingly , a nice , light treat .

67254 | 0.88889 | Like a skillful fisher , the director uses the last act to reel in the audience since its poignancy hooks us completely .
67256 | 0.66667 | Like a veteran head cutter , Barbershop is tuned in to its community .
67258 | 0.76389 | Like all of Egoyan 's work , Ararat is fiercely intelligent and uncommonly ambitious .

67280 | 0.73611 | Like the chilled breath of oral storytelling frozen onto film .
67348 | 0.51389 | Maelstrom is a deliberately unsteady mixture of stylistic elements .
67360 | 0.59722 | Maid in Manhattan might not look so appealing on third or fourth viewing down the road ... But as a high concept vehicle for two bright stars of the moment who can rise to fans ' lofty expectations , the movie passes inspection .

69477 | 0.79167 | The dragons are the real stars of Reign of Fire and you wo n't be disappointed .
69483 | 0.875 | The emotion is impressively true for being so hot-blooded , and both leads are up to the task .
69488 | 0.91667 | The enjoyable Undercover Brother , a zany mix of Saturday Night Live-style parody , '70s Blaxploitation films and goofball action comedy gone wild , dishes out a ton of laughs that everyone can enjoy .
69494 | 0.875 | The ensemble cast turns in a collectively stellar performance , and the writing is tight and truthful , full of funny situations and honest observations .
69495 | 0.88889 | The entire cast is first-rate , especially Sorvino .
69502 | 0.79167 | The evocative imagery and gentle , lapping rhythms of this film are infectious -- it gets under our skin and draws us in long before the plot kicks into gear .
69516 | 0.76389 | The film 's highlight is definitely its screenplay , both for the rhapsodic dialogue that jumps off the page , and for the memorable character creations .
69523 | 0.63889 | The film 's messages of tolerance and diversity are n't particularly original , but one ca n't help but be drawn in by the sympathetic characters .
69531 | 0.61111 | The film 's plot may be shallow , but you 've never seen the deep like you see it in these harrowing surf shots .
69535 | 0.66667 | The film , despite the gratuitous cinematic distractions impressed upon it , is still good fun .
69538 | 0.69444 | The film , while not exactly assured in its execution , is notable for its sheer audacity and openness .
69539 | 0.80556 | The film does a solid job of slowly , steadily building up to the climactic burst of violence .
69540 | 0.72222 | The film gets close to the chimps the same way Goodall did , with a serious minded patience , respect and affection .
69546 | 0.76389 | The film has an infectious enthusiasm and we 're touched by the film 's conviction that all life centered on that place , that time and that sport .
69547 | 0.86111 | The film has the courage of its convictions and excellent performances on its side .
69548 | 0.75 | The film has the uncanny ability to right itself precisely when you think it 's in danger of going wrong .
69550 | 0.83333 | The film is a hoot , and is just as good , if not better than much of what 's on Saturday morning TV especially the pseudo-educational stuff we all ca n't stand .
69552 | 0.77778 | The film is a very good viewing alternative for young women .
69557 | 0.875 | The film is bright and flashy in all the right ways .
69559 | 0.83333 | The film is darkly funny in its observation of just how much more grueling and time-consuming the illusion of work is than actual work .
69560 | 0.81944 | The film is enriched by an imaginatively mixed cast of antic spirits , headed by Christopher Plummer as the subtlest and most complexly evil Uncle Ralph I 've ever seen in the many film and stage adaptations of the work .
69565 | 0.70833 | The film is filled with humorous observations about the general absurdity of modern life as seen through the eyes outsiders , but deftly manages to avoid many of the condescending stereotypes that so often plague films dealing with the mentally ill .

69567 | 0.83333 | The film is impressive for the sights and sounds of the wondrous beats the world has to offer .
69568 | 0.66667 | The film is insightful about Kissinger 's background and history .
69569 | 0.93056 | The film is moody , oozing , chilling and heart-warming all at once ... a twisting , unpredictable , cat-and-mouse thriller .

69571 | 0.77778 | The film is predictable in the reassuring manner of a beautifully sung holiday carol .
69572 | 0.66667 | The film is reasonably entertaining , though it begins to drag two-thirds through , when the melodramatic aspects start to overtake the comedy .
69574 | 0.61111 | The film is saved from are n't - kids-cute sentimentality by a warmth that is n't faked and a stately sense of composition .
69576 | 0.75 | The film jolts the laughs from the audience -- as if by cattle prod .
69578 | 0.83333 | The film just might turn on many people to opera , in general , an art form at once visceral and spiritual , wonderfully vulgar and sublimely lofty -- and as emotionally grand as life .
69579 | 0.73611 | The film presents visceral and dangerously honest revelations about the men and machines behind the curtains of our planet .
69580 | 0.73611 | The film proves unrelentingly grim -- and equally engrossing .

69598 | 0.65278 | The filmmakers wisely decided to let Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin do what he does best , and fashion a story around him .
69601 | 0.75 | The first Bond movie in ages that is n't fake fun .
69607 | 0.94444 | The first Tunisian film I have ever seen , and it 's also probably the most good-hearted yet sensual entertainment I 'm likely to see all year .
69620 | 0.80556 | The fun of the movie is the chance it affords to watch Jackson , who also served as executive producer , take his smooth , shrewd , powerful act abroad .
69622 | 0.65278 | The gags are often a stitch .
69625 | 0.86111 | The genius of the work speaks volumes , offering up a hallucinatory dreamscape that frustrates and captivates .
69628 | 0.66667 | The graphic carnage and re-creation of war-torn Croatia is uncomfortably timely , relevant , and sickeningly real .
69631 | 0.61111 | The heart of the film is a touching reflection on aging , suffering and the prospect of death .
69646 | 0.73611 | The huskies are beautiful , the border collie is funny and the overall feeling is genial and decent .

69659 | 0.73611 | The journey to the secret 's eventual discovery is a separate adventure , and thrill enough .
69661 | 0.88889 | The kind of movie that comes along only occasionally , one so unconventional , gutsy and perfectly executed it takes your breath away .
69663 | 0.81944 | The kind of sweet-and-sour insider movie that film buffs will eat up like so much gelati .
69668 | 0.91667 | The large-format film is well suited to capture these musicians in full regalia and the incredible IMAX sound system lets you feel the beat down to your toes .
69673 | 0.69444 | The leanest and meanest of Solondz 's misanthropic comedies .
69675 | 0.77778 | The level of acting elevates the material above pat inspirational status and gives it a sturdiness and solidity that we 've long associated with Washington the actor .
69679 | 0.75 | The lightest , most breezy movie Steven Spielberg has made in more than a decade .
69684 | 0.75 | The low-key direction is pleasingly emphatic in this properly intense , claustrophobic tale of obsessive love .
69693 | 0.59722 | The message is that even the most unlikely can link together to conquer all kinds of obstacles , whether they be of nature , of man or of one another .
69696 | 0.51389 | The message of such reflections -- intentional or not -- is that while no art grows from a vacuum , many artists exist in one .
69704 | 0.75 | The moral shrapnel and mental shellshock will linger long after this film has ended .
69713 | 0.93056 | The most brilliant work in this genre since the 1984 uncut version of Sergio Leone 's flawed but staggering Once Upon a Time in America .

69729 | 0.68056 | The movie , despite its rough edges and a tendency to sag in certain places , is wry and engrossing .
69730 | 0.76389 | The movie does its best to work us over , with second helpings of love , romance , tragedy , false dawns , real dawns , comic relief , two separate crises during marriage ceremonies , and the lush scenery of the Cotswolds .
69731 | 0.77778 | The movie enters a realm where few non-porn films venture , and comes across as darkly funny , energetic , and surprisingly gentle .
69736 | 0.51389 | The movie has no respect for laws , political correctness or common decency , but it displays something more important : respect for its flawed , crazy people .
69737 | 0.76389 | The movie is ... very funny as you peek at it through the fingers in front of your eyes .
69738 | 0.88889 | The movie is a trove of delights .
69743 | 0.63889 | The movie is amateurish , but it 's a minor treat .
69744 | 0.90278 | The movie is brilliant , really .
69748 | 0.55556 | The movie is our story as much as it is Schmidt 's , no matter if it 's viewed as a self-reflection or cautionary tale .
69758 | 0.77778 | The movie itself is far from disappointing , offering an original take on courtroom movies , a few nifty twists that are so crucial to the genre and another first-rate performance by top-billed star Bruce Willis .
69759 | 0.59722 | The movie plays up the cartoon 's more obvious strength of snazziness while neglecting its less conspicuous writing strength .
69760 | 0.59722 | The movie should be credited with remembering his victims .
69761 | 0.66667 | The movie should jolt you out of your seat a couple of times , give you a few laughs , and leave you feeling like it was worth your seven bucks , even though it does turn out to be a bit of a cheat in the end .
69766 | 0.55556 | The movie ultimately relies a bit too heavily on grandstanding , emotional , Rocky-like moments ... but it 's such a warm and charming package that you 'll feel too happy to argue much .
69772 | 0.79167 | The new Insomnia is a surprisingly faithful remake of its chilly predecessor , and when it does elect to head off in its own direction , it employs changes that fit it well rather than ones that were imposed for the sake of commercial sensibilities .
69774 | 0.69444 | The obnoxious title character provides the drama that gives added clout to this doc .
69777 | 0.75 | The observations of this social\/economic\/urban environment are canny and spiced with irony .
69783 | 0.72222 | The off-center humor is a constant , and the ensemble gives it a buoyant delivery .
69790 | 0.81944 | The one-liners are snappy , the situations volatile and the comic opportunities richly rewarded .
69802 | 0.80556 | The overall effect is awe and affection -- and a strange urge to get on a board and , uh , shred , dude .
69804 | 0.83333 | The overall result is an intelligent , realistic portrayal of testing boundaries .
69807 | 0.76389 | The pain , loneliness and insecurity of the screenwriting process are vividly and painfully brought to slovenly life in this self-deprecating , biting and witty feature written by Charlie Kaufman and his twin brother , Donald , and directed by Spike Jonze .
69809 | 0.61111 | The people in Jessica are so recognizable and true that , as in real life , we 're never sure how things will work out .
69811 | 0.63889 | The performances are uniformly good .
69816 | 0.72222 | The performances of the children , untrained in acting , have an honesty and dignity that breaks your heart .
69819 | 0.90278 | The performers are so spot on , it is hard to conceive anyone else in their roles .
69823 | 0.70833 | The picture runs a mere 84 minutes , but it 's no glance .
69827 | 0.875 | The pleasure of Read My Lips is like seeing a series of perfect black pearls clicking together to form a string .
69835 | 0.66667 | The plot of the comeback curlers is n't very interesting actually , but what I like about Men With Brooms and what is kind of special is how the film knows what 's unique and quirky about Canadians .
69837 | 0.625 | The plot twists give I Am Trying to Break Your Heart an attraction it desperately needed .
69843 | 0.68056 | The power of Shanghai Ghetto , a documentary by Dana Janklowicz-Mann and Amir Mann , rests in the voices of men and women , now in their 70s , who lived there in the 1940s .
69847 | 0.63889 | The powerful success of Read My Lips with such provocative material shows why , after only three films , director\/co-writer Jacques Audiard , though little known in this country , belongs in the very top rank of French filmmakers .
69850 | 0.66667 | The premise of Jason X is silly but strangely believable .
69852 | 0.98611 | The production design , score and choreography are simply intoxicating .
69855 | 0.65278 | The quirky and recessive charms of co-stars Martin Donovan and Mary-Louise Parker help overcome the problematic script .
69859 | 0.84722 | The rare movie that 's as crisp and to the point as the novel on which it 's based .
69862 | 0.625 | The re-release of Ron Howard 's Apollo 13 in the IMAX format proves absolutely that really , really , really good things can come in enormous packages .
69863 | 0.72222 | The result is somewhat satisfying -- it still comes from Spielberg , who has never made anything that was n't at least watchable .
69867 | 0.79167 | The result puts a human face on Derrida , and makes one of the great minds of our times interesting and accessible to people who normally could n't care less .
69869 | 0.54167 | The results , if not memorable , are at least interesting .
69873 | 0.72222 | The rich performances by Friel -- and especially Williams , an American actress who becomes fully English -- round out the square edges .
69876 | 0.88889 | The riveting performances by the incredibly flexible cast make Love a joy to behold .
69890 | 0.86111 | The script by David Koepp is perfectly serviceable and because he gives the story some soul ... he elevates the experience to a more mythic level .
69891 | 0.72222 | The script is smart and dark - hallelujah for small favors .
69892 | 0.69444 | The script manages the rare trick of seeming at once both refreshingly different and reassuringly familiar .
69895 | 0.88889 | The search for redemption makes for a touching love story , mainly because Blanchett and Ribisi compellingly tap into a spiritual aspect of their characters ' suffering .
69901 | 0.63889 | The sentimental script has problems , but the actors pick up the slack .
69905 | 0.76389 | The series ' message about making the right choice in the face of tempting alternatives remains prominent , as do the girls ' amusing personalities .
69908 | 0.77778 | The sight of the spaceship on the launching pad is duly impressive in IMAX dimensions , as are shots of the astronauts floating in their cabins .
69913 | 0.69444 | The spaniel-eyed Jean Reno infuses Hubert with a mixture of deadpan cool , wry humor and just the measure of tenderness required to give this comic slugfest some heart .
69923 | 0.76389 | The stars may be college kids , but the subject matter is as adult as you can get : the temptations of the flesh are unleashed by a slightly crazed , overtly determined young woman and a one-night swim turns into an ocean of trouble .
69934 | 0.83333 | The story , once it gets rolling , is nothing short of a great one .
69943 | 0.73611 | The story is a rather simplistic one : grief drives her , love drives him , and a second chance to find love in the most unlikely place - it struck a chord in me .
69949 | 0.61111 | The story line may be 127 years old , but El Crimen del Padre Amaro ... could n't be more timely in its despairing vision of corruption within the Catholic establishment .
69950 | 0.83333 | The story ultimately takes hold and grips hard .
69956 | 1 | The storylines are woven together skilfully , the magnificent swooping aerial shots are breathtaking , and the overall experience is awesome .
69962 | 0.66667 | The storytelling may be ordinary , but the cast is one of those all-star reunions that fans of Gosford Park have come to assume is just another day of Brit cinema .
69970 | 0.55556 | The strong subject matter continues to shock throughout the film .
69977 | 0.70833 | The structure is simple , but in its own way , Rabbit-Proof Fence is a quest story as grand as The Lord of the Rings .
69983 | 0.79167 | The subtitled costume drama is set in a remote African empire before cell phones , guns , and the internal combustion engine , but the politics that thump through it are as timely as tomorrow .
69986 | 0.66667 | The success of Undercover Brother is found in its ability to spoof both black and white stereotypes equally .
69991 | 0.75 | The sword fighting is well done and Auteuil is a goofy pleasure .
69993 | 0.70833 | The tasteful little revision works wonders , enhancing the cultural and economic subtext , bringing richer meaning to the story 's morals .
69999 | 0.58333 | The tonal shifts are jolting , and though Wen 's messages are profound and thoughtfully delivered , more thorough transitions would have made the film more cohesive .
70000 | 0.58333 | The tone errs on the shrill side , tempered by a soft southern gentility that speaks of beauty , grace and a closet full of skeletons .
70003 | 0.79167 | The trick when watching Godard is to catch the pitch of his poetics , savor the pleasure of his sounds and images , and ponder the historical , philosophical , and ethical issues that intersect with them .
70010 | 0.83333 | The two leads , nearly perfect in their roles , bring a heart and reality that buoy the film , and at times , elevate it to a superior crime movie .
70013 | 0.98611 | The universal theme of becoming a better person through love has never been filmed more irresistibly than in ` Baran . '
70019 | 0.86111 | The urban landscapes are detailed down to the signs on the kiosks , and the color palette , with lots of somber blues and pinks , is dreamy and evocative .
70023 | 0.76389 | The usual movie rah-rah , pleasantly and predictably delivered in low-key style by director Michael Apted and writer Tom Stoppard .
70025 | 0.76389 | The viewer takes great pleasure in watching the resourceful Molly stay a step ahead of her pursuers .
70026 | 0.80556 | The way the roundelay of partners functions , and the interplay within partnerships and among partnerships and the general air of Gator-bashing are consistently delightful .
70029 | 0.59722 | The whole mildly pleasant outing -- the R rating is for brief nudity and a grisly corpse -- remains aloft not on its own self-referential hot air , but on the inspired performance of Tim Allen .
70032 | 0.86111 | The wonder of Mostly Martha is the performance of Gedeck , who makes Martha enormously endearing .
70035 | 0.72222 | The word that comes to mind , while watching Eric Rohmer 's tribute to a courageous Scottish lady , is painterly .
70037 | 0.66667 | The work of an artist tormented by his heritage , using his storytelling ability to honor the many faceless victims .
70042 | 0.875 | The writing is clever and the cast is appealing .
70049 | 0.83333 | The year 's greatest adventure , and Jackson 's limited but enthusiastic adaptation has made literature literal without killing its soul -- a feat any thinking person is bound to appreciate .
70055 | 0.81944 | The year 2002 has conjured up more coming-of-age stories than seem possible , but Take Care of My Cat emerges as the very best of them .
70067 | 0.72222 | There 's a lot to recommend Read My Lips .
70068 | 0.73611 | There 's a spontaneity to The Chateau , a sense of light-heartedness , that makes it attractive throughout .
70069 | 0.63889 | There 's just something about watching a squad of psychopathic underdogs whale the tar out of unsuspecting lawmen that reaches across time and distance .
70079 | 0.79167 | There 's no conversion effort , much of the writing is genuinely witty and both stars are appealing enough to probably have a good shot at a Hollywood career , if they want one .
70084 | 0.84722 | There 's none of the happily-ever - after spangle of Monsoon Wedding in Late Marriage -- and that 's part of what makes Dover Kosashvili 's outstanding feature debut so potent .
70094 | 0.81944 | There 's nothing like love to give a movie a B-12 shot , and CQ shimmers with it .
70095 | 0.79167 | There 's nothing more satisfying during a summer of event movies than a spy thriller like The Bourne Identity that 's packed with just as much intelligence as action .
70097 | 0.86111 | There 's so much to look at in Metropolis you hate to tear your eyes away from the images long enough to read the subtitles .
70098 | 0.55556 | There 's something about a marching band that gets me where I live .
70103 | 0.52778 | There 's very little sense to what 's going on here , but the makers serve up the cliches with considerable dash .
70105 | 0.56944 | There are far worse messages to teach a young audience , which will probably be perfectly happy with the sloppy slapstick comedy .
70109 | 0.76389 | There are flaws , but also stretches of impact and moments of awe ; we 're wrapped up in the characters , how they make their choices , and why .
70115 | 0.69444 | There are laughs aplenty , and , as a bonus , viewers do n't have to worry about being subjected to farts , urine , feces , semen , or any of the other foul substances that have overrun modern-day comedies .
70116 | 0.77778 | There are moments of hilarity to be had .
70127 | 0.73611 | There are some movies that hit you from the first scene and you know it 's going to be a trip .
70133 | 0.58333 | There are times when you wish that the movie had worked a little harder to conceal its contrivances , but Brown Sugar turns out to be a sweet and enjoyable fantasy .
70136 | 0.75 | There is a freedom to watching stunts that are this crude , this fast-paced and this insane .
70137 | 0.79167 | There is a strong directorial stamp on every frame of this stylish film that is able to visualize schizophrenia but is still confident enough to step back and look at the sick character with a sane eye .
70138 | 0.80556 | There is a welcome lack of pretension about the film , which very simply sets out to entertain and ends up delivering in good measure .
70139 | 0.84722 | There is greatness here .
70140 | 0.65278 | There is little question that this is a serious work by an important director who has something new to say about how , in the flip-flop of courtship , we often reel in when we should be playing out .
70142 | 0.77778 | There is no denying the power of Polanski 's film ...
70148 | 0.81944 | There is no substitute for on-screen chemistry , and when Friel pulls the strings that make Williams sink into melancholia , the reaction in Williams is as visceral as a gut punch .
70154 | 0.76389 | These characters are so well established that the gang feels comfortable with taking insane liberties and doing the goofiest stuff out of left field , and I 'm all for that .
70157 | 0.83333 | These three films form a remarkably cohesive whole , both visually and thematically , through their consistently sensitive and often exciting treatment of an ignored people .
70162 | 0.70833 | They 're just a couple of cops in Copmovieland , these two , but in Narc , they find new routes through a familiar neighborhood .
70168 | 0.88889 | Think of it as Gidget , only with muscles and a lot more smarts , but just as endearing and easy to watch .
70173 | 0.75 | This 90-minute postmodern voyage was more diverting and thought-provoking than I 'd expected it to be .
70175 | 0.58333 | This big screen caper has a good bark , far from being a bow-wow .
70178 | 0.86111 | This charming , thought-provoking New York fest of life and love has its rewards .
70180 | 0.79167 | This charming but slight tale has warmth , wit and interesting characters compassionately portrayed .
70189 | 0.55556 | This engrossing , characteristically complex Tom Clancy thriller is shifty in the manner in which it addresses current terrorism anxieties and sidesteps them at the same time .
70191 | 0.91667 | This enthralling documentary ... is at once playful and haunting , an in-depth portrait of an iconoclastic artist who was fundamentally unknowable even to his closest friends .
70193 | 0.66667 | This fascinating experiment plays as more of a poetic than a strict reality , creating an intriguing species of artifice that gives The Lady and the Duke something of a theatrical air .
70194 | 0.65278 | This film can only point the way -- but thank goodness for this signpost .
70195 | 0.77778 | This film is so different from The Apple and so striking that it can only encourage us to see Samira Makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility , working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success .
70196 | 0.86111 | This film puts Wang at the forefront of China 's Sixth Generation of film makers .
70199 | 0.65278 | This filmed Tosca -- not the first , by the way -- is a pretty good job , if it 's filmed Tosca that you want .
70203 | 0.75 | This in-depth study of important developments of the computer industry should make it required viewing in university computer science departments for years to come .
70204 | 0.63889 | This is Christmas Future for a lot of baby boomers .
70205 | 1 | This is DiCaprio 's best performance in anything ever , and easily the most watchable film of the year .
70210 | 0.70833 | This is a film that manages to find greatness in the hue of its drastic iconography .
70211 | 0.88889 | This is a finely written , superbly acted offbeat thriller .
70212 | 0.58333 | This is a harrowing movie about how parents know where all the buttons are , and how to push them .
70216 | 0.80556 | This is a sincerely crafted picture that deserves to emerge from the traffic jam of holiday movies .
70217 | 0.76389 | This is a smart movie that knows its classical music , knows its Freud and knows its Sade .
70218 | 0.95833 | This is a story that zings all the way through with originality , humour and pathos .

106343 | 0.72222 | Hugh Grant 's act is so consuming that sometimes it 's difficult to tell who the other actors in the movie are .
106347 | 0.80556 | Hugh Grant , who has a good line in charm , has never been more charming than in About a Boy .
106354 | 0.58333 | Humorous , artsy , and even cute , in an off-kilter , dark , vaguely disturbing way .
106379 | 0.72222 | I 'm going to give it a marginal thumbs up .
106381 | 0.59722 | I 'm happy to have seen it -- not as an alternate version , but as the ultimate exercise in viewing deleted scenes .
106387 | 0.75 | I 'm not a fan of the phrase ` life affirming ' because it usually means ` schmaltzy , ' but Real Women Have Curves truly is life affirming .
106394 | 0.54167 | I 'm not saying that Ice Age does n't have some fairly pretty pictures , but there 's not enough substance in the story to actually give them life .
106411 | 0.70833 | I 've yet to find an actual Vietnam War combat movie actually produced by either the North or South Vietnamese , but at least now we 've got something pretty damn close .
106457 | 0.84722 | I had a dream that a smart comedy would come along to rescue me from a summer of teen-driven , toilet-humor codswallop , and its name was Earnest .
106459 | 0.54167 | I had more fun with Ben Stiller 's Zoolander , which I thought was rather clever .
106469 | 0.68056 | I have a new favorite musical -- and I 'm not even a fan of the genre
106499 | 0.70833 | I liked a lot of the smaller scenes .
106501 | 0.65278 | I liked it just enough .
106531 | 0.80556 | I was amused and entertained by the unfolding of Bielinsky 's cleverly constructed scenario , and greatly impressed by the skill of the actors involved in the enterprise .
106538 | 0.59722 | I wo n't argue with anyone who calls ` Slackers ' dumb , insulting , or childish ... but I laughed so much that I did n't mind .
106540 | 0.55556 | I would be shocked if there was actually one correct interpretation , but that should n't make the movie or the discussion any less enjoyable .
106557 | 0.79167 | Ice Age wo n't drop your jaw , but it will warm your heart , and I 'm giving it a strong thumbs up .
106562 | 0.54167 | If Borstal Boy is n't especially realistic , it is an engaging nostalgia piece .
106575 | 0.51389 | If Signs is a good film , and it is , the essence of a great one is in there somewhere .
106577 | 0.59722 | If Sinise 's character had a brain his ordeal would be over in five minutes but instead the plot goes out of its way to introduce obstacles for him to stumble over .
106579 | 0.76389 | If The Man from Elysian Fields is doomed by its smallness , it is also elevated by it -- the kind of movie that you enjoy more because you 're one of the lucky few who sought it out .
106585 | 0.66667 | If it 's not entirely memorable , the movie is certainly easy to watch .
106590 | 0.69444 | If it 's unnerving suspense you 're after -- you 'll find it with Ring , an indisputably spooky film ; with a screenplay to die for .
106592 | 0.68056 | If not a home run , then at least a solid base hit .
106597 | 0.61111 | If the film 's vision of sport as a secular religion is a bit cloying , its through-line of family and community is heartening in the same way that each season marks a new start .
106599 | 0.73611 | If the material is slight and admittedly manipulative , Jacquot preserves Tosca 's intoxicating ardor through his use of the camera .
106603 | 0.69444 | If the plot seems a bit on the skinny side , that 's because Panic Room is interested in nothing more than sucking you in ... and making you sweat .
106607 | 0.81944 | If the real-life story is genuinely inspirational , the movie stirs us as well .
106617 | 0.70833 | If you 're in the right B-movie frame of mind , it may just scare the pants off you .
106621 | 0.79167 | If you 're looking for an intelligent movie in which you can release your pent up anger , ENOUGH is just the ticket you need .
106626 | 0.66667 | If you 've grown tired of going where no man has gone before , but several movies have - take heart .
106629 | 0.69444 | If you 've the patience , there are great rewards here .
106639 | 0.66667 | If you can push on through the slow spots , you 'll be rewarded with some fine acting .
106645 | 0.79167 | If you like an extreme action-packed film with a hint of humor , then Triple X marks the spot .
106649 | 0.68056 | If you think it 's a riot to see Rob Schneider in a young woman 's clothes , then you 'll enjoy The Hot Chick .
106651 | 0.59722 | If you thought Tom Hanks was just an ordinary big-screen star , wait until you 've seen him eight stories tall .
106680 | 0.65278 | In Death to Smoochy , we do n't get Williams ' usual tear and a smile , just sneers and bile , and the spectacle is nothing short of refreshing .
106682 | 0.84722 | In IMAX in short , it 's just as wonderful on the big screen .
106688 | 0.81944 | In addition to scoring high for originality of plot -- putting together familiar themes of family , forgiveness and love in a new way -- Lilo & Stitch has a number of other assets to commend it to movie audiences both innocent and jaded .
106691 | 0.79167 | In an era where big stars and high production values are standard procedure , Narc strikes a defiantly retro chord , and outpaces its contemporaries with daring and verve .
106693 | 0.59722 | In capturing the understated comedic agony of an ever-ruminating , genteel yet decadent aristocracy that can no longer pay its bills , the film could just as well be addressing the turn of the 20th century into the 21st .
106698 | 0.76389 | In his latest effort , Storytelling , Solondz has finally made a movie that is n't just offensive -- it also happens to be good .
106706 | 0.58333 | In my opinion , Analyze That is not as funny or entertaining as Analyze This , but it is a respectable sequel .
106708 | 0.69444 | In the director 's cut , the film is not only a love song to the movies but it also is more fully an example of the kind of lush , all-enveloping movie experience it rhapsodizes .
106710 | 0.69444 | In the end , the film is less the cheap thriller you 'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters -- damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide .
106712 | 0.625 | In the end there is one word that best describes this film : honest .
106718 | 0.59722 | In the telling of a story largely untold , Bui chooses to produce something that is ultimately suspiciously familiar .
106731 | 0.68056 | In visual fertility Treasure Planet rivals the top Japanese animations of recent vintage .
106739 | 0.55556 | Innocuous enough to make even Jean-Claude Van Damme look good .
106760 | 0.84722 | Intensely romantic , thought-provoking and even an engaging mystery .
106761 | 0.52778 | Interesting , but not compelling .
106763 | 0.88889 | Intriguing and downright intoxicating .
106790 | 0.81944 | Is not so much a work of entertainment as it is a unique , well-crafted psychological study of grief .
106797 | 0.68056 | It 's ... worth the extra effort to see an artist , still committed to growth in his ninth decade , change while remaining true to his principles with a film whose very subject is , quite pointedly , about the peril of such efforts .
106804 | 0.52778 | It 's a drawling , slobbering , lovable run-on sentence of a film , a Southern Gothic with the emotional arc of its raw blues soundtrack .
106811 | 0.58333 | It 's a good film , but it falls short of its aspiration to be a true ` epic ' .
106812 | 0.88889 | It 's a great American adventure and a wonderful film to bring to IMAX .
106814 | 0.83333 | It 's a rollicking adventure for you and all your mateys , regardless of their ages .
106815 | 0.73611 | It 's a scorcher .
106816 | 0.63889 | It 's a sharp movie about otherwise dull subjects .
106817 | 0.59722 | It 's a sight to behold .
106820 | 0.77778 | It 's a testament to De Niro and director Michael Caton-Jones that by movie 's end , we accept the characters and the film , flaws and all .
106821 | 0.69444 | It 's a very tasteful rock and roll movie .
106823 | 0.80556 | It 's a very valuable film ...
106827 | 0.69444 | It 's about issues most adults have to face in marriage and I think that 's what I liked about it -- the real issues tucked between the silly and crude storyline .
106828 | 0.55556 | It 's about time .
106832 | 0.81944 | It 's always enthralling .
106834 | 0.55556 | It 's an actor 's showcase that accomplishes its primary goal without the use of special effects , but rather by emphasizing the characters -- including the supporting ones .
106840 | 0.76389 | It 's an entertaining movie , and the effects , boosted to the size of a downtown hotel , will all but take you to outer space .
106841 | 0.81944 | It 's an exhilarating place to visit , this laboratory of laughter .
106843 | 0.54167 | It 's better than mid-range Steven Seagal , but not as sharp as Jet Li on rollerblades .
106852 | 0.86111 | It 's dark but has wonderfully funny moments ; you care about the characters ; and the action and special effects are first-rate .
106853 | 0.76389 | It 's definitely a step in the right direction .
106863 | 0.52778 | It 's easy to be cynical about documentaries in which underdogs beat the odds and the human spirit triumphs , but Westbrook 's foundation and Dalrymple 's film earn their uplift .
106869 | 0.70833 | It 's enough to watch Huppert scheming , with her small , intelligent eyes as steady as any noir villain , and to enjoy the perfectly pitched web of tension that Chabrol spins .
106874 | 0.73611 | It 's excessively quirky and a little underconfident in its delivery , but otherwise this is the best ` old neighborhood ' project since Christopher Walken kinda romanced Cyndi Lauper in The Opportunists .
106880 | 0.72222 | It 's got all the familiar Bruckheimer elements , and Schumacher does probably as good a job as anyone at bringing off the Hopkins\/Rock collision of acting styles and onscreen personas .
106904 | 0.66667 | It 's more enjoyable than I expected , though , and that 's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs .
106910 | 0.66667 | It 's never laugh-out-loud funny , but it is frequently amusing .
106916 | 0.79167 | It 's nice to see Piscopo again after all these years , and Chaykin and Headly are priceless .
106922 | 0.55556 | It 's not a film to be taken literally on any level , but its focus always appears questionable .
106926 | 0.51389 | It 's not hateful .
106932 | 0.63889 | It 's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time .
106938 | 0.65278 | It 's not particularly well made , but since I found myself howling more than cringing , I 'd say the film works .
106947 | 0.77778 | It 's rare to find a film to which the adjective ` gentle ' applies , but the word perfectly describes Pauline & Paulette .
106953 | 0.56944 | It 's sobering , particularly if anyone still thinks this conflict can be resolved easily , or soon .
106954 | 0.63889 | It 's sort of a 21st century morality play with a Latino hip hop beat .
106961 | 0.84722 | It 's sweet , funny , charming , and completely delightful .
106969 | 0.80556 | It 's the kind of effectively creepy-scary thriller that has you fixating on a far corner of the screen at times because your nerves just ca n't take it any more .
106974 | 0.54167 | It 's the unsettling images of a war-ravaged land that prove more potent and riveting than the unlikely story of Sarah and Harrison .
106978 | 0.72222 | It 's unlikely we 'll see a better thriller this year .
106979 | 0.51389 | It 's up to you to decide whether to admire these people 's dedication to their cause or be repelled by their dogmatism , manipulativeness and narrow , fearful view of American life .
106980 | 0.83333 | It 's worth taking the kids to .
106985 | 0.79167 | It can be safely recommended as a video\/DVD babysitter .
106989 | 0.66667 | It certainly wo n't win any awards in the plot department but it sets out with no pretensions and delivers big time .
106991 | 0.76389 | It deserves to be seen everywhere .
106997 | 0.63889 | It does n't matter that the film is less than 90 minutes .
107005 | 0.69444 | It has a dashing and resourceful hero ; a lisping , reptilian villain ; big fights ; big hair ; lavish period scenery ; and a story just complicated enough to let you bask in your own cleverness as you figure it out .
107012 | 0.83333 | It is different from others in its genre in that it is does not rely on dumb gags , anatomical humor , or character cliches ; it primarily relies on character to tell its story .
107013 | 0.76389 | It is hard not to be especially grateful for freedom after a film like this .
107014 | 0.70833 | It is life affirming and heartbreaking , sweet without the decay factor , funny and sad .
107028 | 0.91667 | It leaves little doubt that Kidman has become one of our best actors .
107032 | 0.625 | It may ... work as a jaunt down memory lane for teens and young adults who grew up on televised Scooby-Doo shows or reruns .
107037 | 0.68056 | It may be a no-brainer , but at least it 's a funny no-brainer .
107047 | 0.72222 | It may not be particularly innovative , but the film 's crisp , unaffected style and air of gentle longing make it unexpectedly rewarding .
107050 | 0.69444 | It offers a glimpse of the Solomonic decision facing Jewish parents in those turbulent times : to save their children and yet to lose them .
107052 | 0.56944 | It pulls the rug out from under you , just when you 're ready to hate one character , or really sympathize with another character , something happens to send you off in different direction .
107053 | 0.70833 | It rapidly develops into a gut-wrenching examination of the way cultural differences and emotional expectations collide .
107054 | 0.51389 | It says a lot about a filmmaker when he can be wacky without clobbering the audience over the head and still maintain a sense of urgency and suspense .
107059 | 0.70833 | It seems impossible that an epic four-hour Indian musical about a cricket game could be this good , but it is .
107073 | 0.61111 | It uses some of the figures from the real-life story to portray themselves in the film .
107075 | 0.56944 | It was filled with shootings , beatings , and more cussing than you could shake a stick at .
107077 | 0.58333 | It will break your heart many times over .
107078 | 0.875 | It will guarantee to have you leaving the theater with a smile on your face .
107080 | 0.90278 | It works its magic with such exuberance and passion that the film 's length becomes a part of its fun .
107089 | 0.51389 | It wraps up a classic mother\/daughter struggle in recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while the audience can tell it 's not all new , at least it looks pretty .
107097 | 0.73611 | Its compelling mix of trial movie , escape movie and unexpected fable ensures the film never feels draggy .
107102 | 0.61111 | Its spirit of iconoclastic abandon -- however canned -- makes for unexpectedly giddy viewing .
107105 | 0.77778 | Its story about a young Chinese woman , Ah Na , who has come to New York City to replace past tragedy with the American Dream is one that any art-house moviegoer is likely to find compelling .
107111 | 0.83333 | Its use of the thriller form to examine the labyrinthine ways in which people 's lives cross and change , buffeted by events seemingly out of their control , is intriguing , provocative stuff .
107164 | 0.83333 | Jason Patric and Ray Liotta make for one splendidly cast pair .
107167 | 0.55556 | Jaunty fun , with its celeb-strewn backdrop well used .
107177 | 0.90278 | Jeffs has created a breathtakingly assured and stylish work of spare dialogue and acute expressiveness .
107210 | 0.68056 | Jolie gives it that extra little something that makes it worth checking out at theaters , especially if you 're in the mood for something more comfortable than challenging .
107217 | 0.65278 | Jonathan Parker 's Bartleby should have been the be-all-end-all of the modern-office anomie films .
107221 | 0.90278 | Jones has delivered a solidly entertaining and moving family drama .
107222 | 0.84722 | Jones has tackled a meaty subject and drawn engaging characters while peppering the pages with memorable zingers .
107256 | 0.73611 | Just as the recent Argentine film Son of the Bride reminded us that a feel-good movie can still show real heart , Time of Favor presents us with an action movie that actually has a brain .
107296 | 0.83333 | Kids should have a stirring time at this beautifully drawn movie .
107317 | 0.83333 | Kinnear ... gives his best screen performance with an oddly winning portrayal of one of life 's ultimate losers .
107367 | 0.58333 | LaBute ca n't avoid a fatal mistake in the modern era : He 's changed the male academic from a lower-class Brit to an American , a choice that upsets the novel 's exquisite balance and shreds the fabric of the film .
107369 | 0.51389 | LaBute was more fun when his characters were torturing each other psychologically and talking about their genitals in public .
107378 | 0.88889 | Lan Yu is a genuine love story , full of traditional layers of awakening and ripening and separation and recovery .
107386 | 0.75 | Late Marriage is an in-your-face family drama and black comedy that is filled with raw emotions conveying despair and love .
107391 | 0.66667 | Lathan and Diggs carry the film with their charisma , and both exhibit sharp comic timing that makes the more hackneyed elements of the film easier to digest .
107400 | 0.90278 | Laugh-out-loud lines , adorably ditsy but heartfelt performances , and sparkling , bittersweet dialogue that cuts to the chase of the modern girl 's dilemma .
107419 | 0.65278 | Leigh is n't breaking new ground , but he knows how a daily grind can kill love .
107424 | 0.58333 | Less cinematically powerful than quietly and deeply moving , which is powerful in itself .
107431 | 0.65278 | Let 's issue a moratorium , effective immediately , on treacly films about inspirational prep-school professors and the children they so heartwarmingly motivate .
107436 | 0.83333 | Like Brosnan 's performance , Evelyn comes from the heart .
107438 | 0.77778 | Like Kissing Jessica Stein , Amy 's Orgasm has a key strength in its willingness to explore its principal characters with honesty , insight and humor .
107441 | 0.73611 | Like Smoke Signals , the film is also imbued with strong themes of familial ties and spirituality that are powerful and moving without stooping to base melodrama
107447 | 0.70833 | Like The Rugrats movies , The Wild Thornberrys Movie does n't offer much more than the series , but its emphasis on caring for animals and respecting other cultures is particularly welcome .
107455 | 0.66667 | Like a precious and finely cut diamond , magnificent to behold in its sparkling beauty yet in reality it 's one tough rock .
107462 | 0.84722 | Like all great films about a life you never knew existed , it offers much to absorb and even more to think about after the final frame .
107466 | 0.79167 | Like its title character , this Nicholas Nickleby finds itself in reduced circumstances -- and , also like its hero , it remains brightly optimistic , coming through in the end .
107472 | 0.61111 | Like many Western action films , this thriller is too loud and thoroughly overbearing , but its heartfelt concern about North Korea 's recent past and South Korea 's future adds a much needed moral weight .
107485 | 0.58333 | Like the series , the movie is funny , smart , visually inventive , and most of all , alive .
107505 | 0.88889 | Literary purists may not be pleased , but as far as mainstream matinee-style entertainment goes , it does a bang-up job of pleasing the crowds .
107549 | 0.83333 | Lovingly photographed in the manner of a Golden Book sprung to life , Stuart Little 2 manages sweetness largely without stickiness .
107558 | 0.61111 | Ludicrous , but director Carl Franklin adds enough flourishes and freak-outs to make it entertaining .
107571 | 0.83333 | MacDowell ... gives give a solid , anguished performance that eclipses nearly everything else she 's ever done .
107582 | 0.51389 | Made-Up lampoons the moviemaking process itself , while shining a not particularly flattering spotlight on America 's skin-deep notions of pulchritude .
107591 | 0.83333 | Maggie Smith as the Ya-Ya member with the O2-tank will absolutely crack you up with her crass , then gasp for gas , verbal deportment .
107602 | 0.70833 | Making such a tragedy the backdrop to a love story risks trivializing it , though Chouraqui no doubt intended the film to affirm love 's power to help people endure almost unimaginable horror .
107611 | 0.73611 | Manages to accomplish what few sequels can -- it equals the original and in some ways even betters it .
107612 | 0.86111 | Manages to be both hugely entertaining and uplifting .
107613 | 0.70833 | Manages to delight without much of a story .
107619 | 0.69444 | Mark Pellington 's latest pop thriller is as kooky and overeager as it is spooky and subtly in love with myth .
107634 | 0.76389 | Maryam is a small film , but it offers large rewards .
107653 | 0.70833 | Max pokes , provokes , takes expressionistic license and hits a nerve ... as far as art is concerned , it 's mission accomplished .
107659 | 0.68056 | May be more genial than ingenious , but it gets the job done .
107664 | 0.61111 | May not be a breakthrough in filmmaking , but it is unwavering and arresting .
107668 | 0.83333 | Mazel tov to a film about a family 's joyous life acting on the Yiddish stage .
107681 | 0.69444 | McGrath has deftly trimmed Dickens ' wonderfully sprawling soap opera , the better to focus on the hero 's odyssey from cowering poverty to courage and happiness .
107699 | 0.54167 | Meant to reduce Blake 's philosophy into a tragic coming-of-age saga punctuated by bursts of animator Todd McFarlane 's superhero dystopia .
107708 | 0.76389 | Mel Gibson fights the good fight in Vietnam in director Randall Wallace 's flag-waving war flick with a core of decency .
107711 | 0.83333 | Melds derivative elements into something that is often quite rich and exciting , and always a beauty to behold .
107727 | 0.69444 | Metaphors abound , but it is easy to take this film at face value and enjoy its slightly humorous and tender story .
107729 | 0.69444 | Meticulously uncovers a trail of outrageous force and craven concealment .
107740 | 0.69444 | Michel Piccoli 's moving performance is this films reason for being .
107765 | 0.52778 | Mild , meandering teen flick .
107769 | 0.61111 | Miller has crafted an intriguing story of maternal instincts and misguided acts of affection .
107790 | 0.86111 | Miyazaki 's nonstop images are so stunning , and his imagination so vivid , that the only possible complaint you could have about Spirited Away is that there is no rest period , no timeout .
107806 | 0.51389 | More of a career curio than a major work .
107814 | 0.73611 | More sophisticated and literate than such pictures usually are ... an amusing little catch .
107815 | 0.70833 | Moretti ... is the rare common-man artist who 's wise enough to recognize that there are few things in this world more complex -- and , as it turns out , more fragile -- than happiness .
107833 | 0.88889 | Move over Bond ; this girl deserves a sequel .
107874 | 0.72222 | Much credit must be given to the water-camera operating team of Don King , Sonny Miller , and Michael Stewart .
107879 | 0.69444 | Much has been written about those years when the psychedelic '60s grooved over into the gay '70s , but words do n't really do the era justice .
107886 | 0.72222 | Much smarter and more attentive than it first sets out to be .
107910 | 0.80556 | My Wife is an Actress has its moments in looking at the comic effects of jealousy .
107960 | 0.80556 | Neil Burger here succeeded in ... making the mystery of four decades back the springboard for a more immediate mystery in the present .
107963 | 0.63889 | Neither quite a comedy nor a romance , more of an impish divertissement of themes that interest Attal and Gainsbourg -- they live together -- the film has a lot of charm .
107974 | 0.66667 | Never lets go your emotions , taking them to surprising highs , sorrowful lows and hidden impulsive niches ... gorgeous , passionate , and at times uncommonly moving .

109879 | 0.84722 | The gags that fly at such a furiously funny pace that the only rip off that we were aware of was the one we felt when the movie ended so damned soon .
109887 | 0.63889 | The hook is the drama within the drama , as an unsolved murder and an unresolved moral conflict jockey for the spotlight .
109889 | 0.69444 | The hypnotic imagery and fragmentary tale explore the connections between place and personal identity .

109983 | 0.86111 | The movie 's captivating details are all in the performances , from Foreman 's barking-mad Taylor to Thewlis 's smoothly sinister Freddie and Bettany\/McDowell 's hard-eyed gangster .
109999 | 0.59722 | The movie is gorgeously made , but it is also somewhat shallow and art-conscious .
110007 | 0.63889 | The movie is so thoughtlessly assembled .

110072 | 0.68056 | The performances are strong , though the subject matter demands acting that borders on hammy at times .
110085 | 0.66667 | The picture 's fascinating byways are littered with trenchant satirical jabs at the peculiar egocentricities of the acting breed .
110095 | 0.68056 | The powder blues and sun-splashed whites of Tunis make an alluring backdrop for this sensuous and spirited tale of a prim widow who finds an unlikely release in belly-dancing clubs .

110112 | 0.63889 | The production values are of the highest and the performances attractive without being memorable .
110115 | 0.73611 | The rare Imax movie that you 'll wish was longer than an hour .

110222 | 0.56944 | The umpteenth summer skinny dip in Jerry Bruckheimer 's putrid pond of retread action twaddle .
110228 | 0.72222 | The underworld urban angst is derivative of Martin Scorsese 's Taxi Driver and Goodfellas , but this film speaks for itself .
110241 | 0.84722 | The unique niche of self-critical , behind-the-scenes navel-gazing Kaufman has carved from Orleans ' story and his own infinite insecurity is a work of outstanding originality .
110246 | 0.59722 | The warnings to resist temptation in this film ... are blunt and challenging and offer no easy rewards for staying clean .
110260 | 0.58333 | The wonderful combination of the sweetness and the extraordinary technical accomplishments of the first film are maintained , but its overall impact falls a little flat with a storyline that never quite delivers the original magic .

110293 | 0.77778 | There 's a sheer unbridled delight in the way the story unfurls ...
110294 | 0.63889 | There 's absolutely no reason why Blue Crush , a late-summer surfer girl entry , should be as entertaining as it is
110304 | 0.69444 | There 's much tongue in cheek in the film and there 's no doubt the filmmaker is having fun with it all .

110310 | 0.51389 | There 's no doubting that this is a highly ambitious and personal project for Egoyan , but it 's also one that , next to his best work , feels clumsy and convoluted .
110323 | 0.56944 | There 's no question that Epps scores once or twice , but it 's telling that his funniest moment comes when he falls about ten feet onto his head .
110333 | 0.65278 | There 's real visual charge to the filmmaking , and a strong erotic spark to the most crucial lip-reading sequence .
110334 | 0.75 | There 's something poignant about an artist of 90-plus years taking the effort to share his impressions of life and loss and time and art with us .
110335 | 0.625 | There 's something to be said for a studio-produced film that never bothers to hand viewers a suitcase full of easy answers .
110342 | 0.625 | There 's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there 's nothing else happening .
110343 | 0.66667 | There are enough throwaway references to faith and rainbows to plant smile-button faces on that segment of the populace that made A Walk to Remember a niche hit .
110350 | 0.59722 | There are problems with this film that even 3 Oscar winners ca n't overcome , but it 's a nice girl-buddy movie once it gets rock-n-rolling .

110375 | 0.88889 | There is a real subject here , and it is handled with intelligence and care .
110376 | 0.54167 | There is one surefire way to get a nomination for a best-foreign-film Oscar : Make a movie about whimsical folk who learn a nonchallenging , life-affirming lesson while walking around a foreign city with stunning architecture .

110379 | 0.76389 | There is something that is so meditative and lyrical about Babak Payami 's boldly quirky Iranian drama Secret Ballot ... a charming and evoking little ditty that manages to show the gentle and humane side of Middle Eastern world politics
110397 | 0.69444 | They can and will turn on a dime from oddly humorous to tediously sentimental .
110412 | 0.625 | Thirteen Conversations About One Thing lays out a narrative puzzle that interweaves individual stories , and , like a Mobius strip , elliptically loops back to where it began .
110419 | 0.88889 | This Chicago has hugely imaginative and successful casting to its great credit , as well as one terrific score and attitude to spare .
110428 | 0.65278 | This amiable picture talks tough , but it 's all bluster -- in the end it 's as sweet as Greenfingers ...
110438 | 0.81944 | This fascinating look at Israel in ferment feels as immediate as the latest news footage from Gaza and , because of its heightened , well-shaped dramas , twice as powerful .
110442 | 0.77778 | This film is an act of spiritual faith -- an eloquent , deeply felt meditation on the nature of compassion .
110447 | 0.59722 | This follow-up seems so similar to the 1953 Disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric Peter .
110449 | 0.83333 | This gorgeous epic is guaranteed to lift the spirits of the whole family .
110452 | 0.59722 | This harrowing journey into combat hell vividly captures the chaotic insanity and personal tragedies that are all too abundant when human hatred spews forth unchecked .
110461 | 0.66667 | This humbling little film , fueled by the light comedic work of Zhao Benshan and the delicate ways of Dong Jie , is just the sort for those moviegoers who complain that ` they do n't make movies like they used to anymore . '
110462 | 0.66667 | This is a dark , gritty , sometimes funny little gem .
110463 | 0.91667 | This is a fascinating film because there is no clear-cut hero and no all-out villain .
110474 | 0.86111 | This is a movie full of grace and , ultimately , hope .
110480 | 0.95833 | This is a movie that refreshes the mind and spirit along with the body , so original is its content , look , and style .
110485 | 0.59722 | This is a nervy , risky film , and Villeneuve has inspired Croze to give herself over completely to the tormented persona of Bibi .
110487 | 0.66667 | This is a shrewd and effective film from a director who understands how to create and sustain a mood .
110492 | 0.76389 | This is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker , but good actors , good poetry and good music help sustain it .
110493 | 0.54167 | This is amusing for about three minutes .
110494 | 0.91667 | This is an elegantly balanced movie -- every member of the ensemble has something fascinating to do -- that does n't reveal even a hint of artifice .
110500 | 0.77778 | This is one of those rare docs that paints a grand picture of an era and makes the journey feel like a party .
110505 | 0.86111 | This is one of those war movies that focuses on human interaction rather than battle and action sequences ... and it 's all the stronger because of it .
110510 | 0.875 | This is the best Star Trek movie in a long time .
110513 | 0.68056 | This is the stuff that Disney movies are made of .
110516 | 0.73611 | This kind of hands-on storytelling is ultimately what makes Shanghai Ghetto move beyond a good , dry , reliable textbook and what allows it to rank with its worthy predecessors .
110536 | 0.84722 | This often-hilarious farce manages to generate the belly laughs of lowbrow comedy without sacrificing its high-minded appeal .
110540 | 0.84722 | This quiet , introspective and entertaining independent is worth seeking .
110550 | 0.79167 | This rich , bittersweet Israeli documentary , about the life of song-and-dance-man Pasach ` ke Burstein and his family , transcends ethnic lines .
110556 | 0.72222 | This submarine drama earns the right to be favorably compared to Das Boot .
110590 | 0.66667 | Those who do n't entirely ` get ' Godard 's distinctive discourse will still come away with a sense of his reserved but existential poignancy .
110593 | 0.69444 | Though Nijinsky 's words grow increasingly disturbed , the film maintains a beguiling serenity and poise that make it accessible for a non-narrative feature .
110597 | 0.83333 | Though in some ways similar to Catherine Breillat 's Fat Girl , Rain is the far superior film .
110599 | 0.55556 | Though it flirts with bathos and pathos and the further Oprahfication of the world as we know it , it still cuts all the way down to broken bone .
110603 | 0.76389 | Though its story is only surface deep , the visuals and enveloping sounds of Blue Crush make this surprisingly decent flick worth a summertime look-see .
110605 | 0.75 | Though overall an overwhelmingly positive portrayal , the film does n't ignore the more problematic aspects of Brown 's life .
110607 | 0.66667 | Though the aboriginal aspect lends the ending an extraordinary poignancy , and the story itself could be played out in any working class community in the nation .
110609 | 0.68056 | Though the film is well-intentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable .
110617 | 0.63889 | Though this saga would be terrific to read about , it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch .
110624 | 0.80556 | Throws in enough clever and unexpected twists to make the formula feel fresh .
110666 | 0.875 | To call this one an eventual cult classic would be an understatement , and woe is the horror fan who opts to overlook this goofily endearing and well-lensed gorefest .
110678 | 0.63889 | To those who have not read the book , the film is a much better mother-daughter tale than last summer 's ` Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood , ' but that 's not saying much .
110708 | 0.65278 | Too clever by about nine-tenths .
110738 | 0.75 | Touches smartly and wistfully on a number of themes , not least the notion that the marginal members of society ... might benefit from a helping hand and a friendly kick in the pants .
110765 | 0.88889 | Try as you might to scrutinize the ethics of Kaufman 's approach , somehow it all comes together to create a very compelling , sensitive , intelligent and almost cohesive piece of film entertainment .
110775 | 0.70833 | Tsai Ming-liang 's witty , wistful new film , What Time Is It There ?
110780 | 0.83333 | Tully is worth a look for its true-to-life characters , its sensitive acting , its unadorned view of rural life and the subtle direction of first-timer Hilary Birmingham .
110784 | 0.95833 | Tunney , brimming with coltish , neurotic energy , holds the screen like a true star .
110800 | 0.73611 | Twohy 's a good yarn-spinner , and ultimately the story compels .
110801 | 0.72222 | Twohy knows how to inflate the mundane into the scarifying , and gets full mileage out of the rolling of a stray barrel or the unexpected blast of a phonograph record .
110806 | 0.61111 | UB equally spoofs and celebrates the more outre aspects of ` black culture ' and the dorkier aspects of ` white culture , ' even as it points out how inseparable the two are .
110828 | 0.51389 | Unintelligible , poorly acted , brain-slappingly bad , Harvard Man is ludicrous enough that it could become a cult classic .
110839 | 0.75 | Uplifting , funny and wise .
110843 | 0.61111 | Upsetting and thought-provoking , the film has an odd purity that does n't bring you into the characters so much as it has you study them .
110869 | 0.69444 | Very amusing , not the usual route in a thriller , and the performances are odd and pixilated and sometimes both .
110871 | 0.625 | Very predictable but still entertaining
110877 | 0.52778 | Viewed as a comedy , a romance , a fairy tale , or a drama , there 's nothing remotely triumphant about this motion picture .
110895 | 0.875 | Visually breathtaking , viscerally exciting , and dramatically moving , it 's the very definition of epic adventure .
110911 | 0.75 | Waiting for Godard can be fruitful : ` In Praise of Love ' is the director 's epitaph for himself .
110936 | 0.68056 | Washington overcomes the script 's flaws and envelops the audience in his character 's anguish , anger and frustration .
110937 | 0.63889 | Watching Austin Powers in Goldmember is like binging on cotton candy .
110956 | 0.58333 | Watching Spirited Away is like watching an Eastern imagination explode .
110958 | 0.61111 | Watching The Powerpuff Girls Movie , my mind kept returning to one anecdote for comparison : the cartoon in Japan that gave people seizures .
110983 | 0.625 | Weighty and ponderous but every bit as filling as the treat of the title .
110998 | 0.56944 | Were it not for a sentimental resolution that explains way more about Cal than does the movie or the character any good , Freundlich 's World Traveler might have been one of the more daring and surprising American movies of the year .
111013 | 0.68056 | What 's most memorable about Circuit is that it 's shot on digital video , whose tiny camera enables Shafer to navigate spaces both large ... and small ... with considerable aplomb .
111015 | 0.73611 | What 's so striking about Jolie 's performance is that she never lets her character become a caricature -- not even with that radioactive hair .
111016 | 0.68056 | What 's surprising about this traditional thriller , moderately successful but not completely satisfying , is exactly how genteel and unsurprising the execution turns out to be .
111020 | 0.69444 | What a dumb , fun , curiously adolescent movie this is .
111021 | 0.72222 | What begins as a conventional thriller evolves into a gorgeously atmospheric meditation on life-changing chance encounters .
111022 | 0.51389 | What begins as a film in the tradition of The Graduate quickly switches into something more recyclable than significant .
111024 | 0.625 | What emerges is an unsettling picture of childhood innocence combined with indoctrinated prejudice .
111027 | 0.61111 | What lifts the film high above run-of-the-filth gangster flicks is its refusal to recognise any of the signposts , as if discovering a way through to the bitter end without a map .
111033 | 0.86111 | What makes Salton Sea surprisingly engrossing is that Caruso takes an atypically hypnotic approach to a world that 's often handled in fast-edit , hopped-up fashion .
111037 | 0.70833 | What one is left with , even after the most awful acts are committed , is an overwhelming sadness that feels as if it has made its way into your very bloodstream .
111047 | 0.73611 | What sets this romantic comedy apart from most Hollywood romantic comedies is its low-key way of tackling what seems like done-to-death material .
111081 | 0.84722 | When compared to the usual , more somber festival entries , Davis ' highly personal brand of romantic comedy is a tart , smart breath of fresh air that stands out from the pack even if the picture itself is somewhat problematic .
111083 | 0.875 | When cowering and begging at the feet a scruffy Giannini , Madonna gives her best performance since Abel Ferrara had her beaten to a pulp in his Dangerous Game .
111091 | 0.68056 | Where Janice Beard falters in its recycled aspects , implausibility , and sags in pace , it rises in its courageousness , and comedic employment .
111095 | 0.69444 | Whether or not Ram Dass proves as clear and reliable an authority on that as he was about inner consciousness , Fierce Grace reassures us that he will once again be an honest and loving one .
111100 | 0.66667 | While Broomfield 's film does n't capture the effect of these tragic deaths on hip-hop culture , it succeeds as a powerful look at a failure of our justice system .
111108 | 0.83333 | While it 's nothing we have n't seen before from Murphy , I Spy is still fun and enjoyable and so aggressively silly that it 's more than a worthwhile effort .
111112 | 0.54167 | While kids will probably eat the whole thing up , most adults will be way ahead of the plot .
111114 | 0.81944 | While maintaining the appearance of clinical objectivity , this sad , occasionally horrifying but often inspiring film is among Wiseman 's warmest .
111120 | 0.79167 | While the filmmaking may be a bit disjointed , the subject matter is so fascinating that you wo n't care .
111122 | 0.63889 | While the frequent allusions to gurus and doshas will strike some Westerners as verging on mumbo-jumbo ... broad streaks of common sense emerge with unimpeachable clarity .
111124 | 0.51389 | While the mystery unravels , the characters respond by hitting on each other .
111128 | 0.79167 | While the story does seem pretty unbelievable at times , it 's awfully entertaining to watch .
111130 | 0.69444 | While we no longer possess the lack-of-attention span that we did at seventeen , we had no trouble sitting for Blade II .
111137 | 0.55556 | Who is the audience for Cletis Tout ?
111159 | 0.93056 | Will assuredly rank as one of the cleverest , most deceptively amusing comedies of the year .
111160 | 0.69444 | Will certainly appeal to Asian cult cinema fans and Asiaphiles interested to see what all the fuss is about .
111168 | 0.77778 | Williams absolutely nails Sy 's queasy infatuation and overall strangeness .
111169 | 0.88889 | Williams creates a stunning , Taxi Driver-esque portrayal of a man teetering on the edge of sanity .
111178 | 0.66667 | Wise and deadpan humorous .
111186 | 0.75 | With Spy Kids 2 : The Island of Lost Dreams , the Spy Kids franchise establishes itself as a durable part of the movie landscape : a James Bond series for kids .
111195 | 0.875 | With an admirably dark first script by Brent Hanley , Paxton , making his directorial feature debut , does strong , measured work .
111211 | 0.76389 | With the prospect of films like Kangaroo Jack about to burst across America 's winter movie screens it 's a pleasure to have a film like The Hours as an alternative .

111249 | 0.81944 | Working from a surprisingly sensitive script co-written by Gianni Romoli ... Ozpetek avoids most of the pitfalls you 'd expect in such a potentially sudsy set-up .
111251 | 0.80556 | Works as pretty contagious fun .
111261 | 0.72222 | World Traveler might not go anywhere new , or arrive anyplace special , but it 's certainly an honest attempt to get at something .
111267 | 0.72222 | Worth a look by those on both sides of the issues , if only for the perspective it offers , one the public rarely sees .
111281 | 0.88889 | Writer-director David Jacobson and his star , Jeremy Renner , have made a remarkable film that explores the monster 's psychology not in order to excuse him but rather to demonstrate that his pathology evolved from human impulses that grew hideously twisted .
111291 | 0.77778 | Ya-Yas everywhere will forgive the flaws and love the film .
111318 | 0.65278 | You 'll know a star when you see one .

143399 | 0.68056 | A tough go , but Leigh 's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film 's often-mined and despairing milieu .

144520 | 0.55556 | Clayburgh and Tambor are charming performers ; neither of them deserves Eric Schaeffer .
144555 | 0.52778 | Comedy troupe Broken Lizard 's first movie is very funny but too concerned with giving us a plot .
144612 | 0.63889 | Coppola has made a film of intoxicating atmosphere and little else .

145086 | 0.51389 | Ends up being mostly about ravishing costumes , eye-filling , wide-screen production design and Joan 's wacky decision to stand by her man , no matter how many times he demonstrates that he 's a disloyal satyr .

145231 | 0.59722 | Exists then as an occasionally insightful acting exercise .
145334 | 0.63889 | Fessenden has nurtured his metaphors at the expense of his narrative , but he does display an original talent .
145361 | 0.63889 | First-time writer-director Dylan Kidd also has a good ear for dialogue , and the characters sound like real people .
145442 | 0.59722 | For single digits kidlets Stuart Little 2 is still a no brainer .
145446 | 0.66667 | For the most part , I Spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of Murphy 's better performances in one of his lesser-praised movies .
145678 | 0.52778 | Had the film boasted a clearer , more memorable , the creepiness would have gotten under the skin .
145713 | 0.54167 | Harland Williams is so funny in drag he should consider permanent sex-reassignment .
145720 | 0.68056 | Harrison 's Flowers puts its heart in the right place , but its brains are in no particular place at all .
145818 | 0.55556 | His best film remains his shortest , The Hole , which makes many of the points that this film does but feels less repetitive .
145884 | 0.52778 | How anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us .
145945 | 0.77778 | I 'm guessing the director is a magician .
146061 | 0.56944 | I found myself more appreciative of what the director was trying to do than of what he had actually done .
146078 | 0.58333 | I highly recommend Irwin , but not in the way this film showcases him .
146095 | 0.77778 | I loved looking at this movie .

146206 | 0.58333 | If this disposable tissue has one wild card , it 's John Turturro , who 's simply fab as a Spanish butler with a foot fetish .
146242 | 0.80556 | If you liked the 1982 film then , you 'll still like it now .
146294 | 0.56944 | In both the writing and cutting , it does not achieve the kind of dramatic unity that transports you .
146311 | 0.51389 | In the end , Ted Bundy 's only justification is the director 's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac ; there 's no larger point , and little social context .
146348 | 0.72222 | Intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story 's least interesting subject .
146406 | 0.63889 | It 's a decent glimpse into a time period , and an outcast , that is no longer accessible , but it does n't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor .
146426 | 0.54167 | It 's a trifle .
146432 | 0.63889 | It 's a very sincere work , but it would be better as a diary or documentary .
146437 | 0.63889 | It 's all very cute , though not terribly funny if you 're more than six years old .
146442 | 0.51389 | It 's also clear from the start that The Transporter is running purely on adrenaline , and once the initial high wears off , the film 's shortcomings start to shine through .
146460 | 0.72222 | It 's better than The Phantom Menace .
146487 | 0.52778 | It 's fun , but a psychological mess , with Austin Powers bumping his head on the way out of the closet .
146507 | 0.58333 | It 's harmless , diverting fluff .
146568 | 0.56944 | It 's not that Waiting For Happiness is a bad film , because it is n't .
146581 | 0.55556 | It 's not without its pleasures , but I 'll stick with The Tune .
146597 | 0.75 | It 's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible .
146635 | 0.55556 | It 's tough , astringent , darkly funny and ... well , it 's also generic , untidy , condescending and mild of impact rather than stunning .
146639 | 0.625 | It almost plays like Solaris , but with guns and jokes .
146651 | 0.55556 | It conveys a simple message in a visual style that is willfully overwrought .
146701 | 0.63889 | It is also , at times , curiously moving .
146724 | 0.52778 | It may be a prize winner , but Teacher is a bomb .
146733 | 0.52778 | It plays like a big-budget , after-school special with a generous cast , who at times lift the material from its well-meaning clunkiness .
146737 | 0.81944 | It should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit .
146946 | 0.58333 | Just an average comedic dateflick but not a waste of time .
147154 | 0.55556 | Life or Something Like It has its share of high points , but it misses too many opportunities .
147211 | 0.55556 | Literally nothing in The Pool is new , but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980 's this one should appease you for 90 minutes .
147270 | 0.66667 | Lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland , basically .
147313 | 0.51389 | Makes for some truly odd , at times confusing , kids entertainment ... but at least this time there 's some centered storytelling to go along with all the weird stuff .
147399 | 0.63889 | McConaughey 's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script .
147455 | 0.79167 | Miller is playing so free with emotions , and the fact that children are hostages to fortune , that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness .
147456 | 0.625 | Minority Report is exactly what the title indicates , a report .
147497 | 0.55556 | Morrissette 's script and direction show a fair amount of intelligence and wit -- but it does n't signify a whole lot either .
147519 | 0.56944 | Movies like this are selling the old European candor , the old wink of ` bold ' revelation .
147818 | 0.52778 | Nothing more substantial than a fitfully clever doodle .
147828 | 0.61111 | Now here 's a sadistic bike flick that would have made Vittorio De Sica proud .
147847 | 0.55556 | Occasionally funny , sometimes inspiring , often boring .
147885 | 0.58333 | On the bright side , it contains Jesse Ventura 's best work since the XFL .
147939 | 0.56944 | Only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry .
147983 | 0.51389 | Overall , it 's a pretty mediocre family film .
148249 | 0.73611 | Rather quickly , the film falls into a soothing formula of brotherly conflict and reconciliation .
148328 | 0.63889 | Roger Michell , who did an appealing job directing Persuasion and Notting Hill in England , gets too artsy in his American debut .
148454 | 0.56944 | Scorsese at his best makes gangster films that are equally lovely but also relentlessly brutal and brutally intelligent ; Perdition , meanwhile , reads more like Driving Miss Daisy than GoodFellas .
148487 | 0.52778 | Sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary .
148494 | 0.80556 | Serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in America in 2002 .
148513 | 0.55556 | Sex With Strangers will shock many with its unblinking frankness .
148643 | 0.65278 | Slick piece of cross-promotion .
148652 | 0.54167 | Slow , dry , poorly cast , but beautifully shot .
148671 | 0.58333 | So faithful to the doldrums of the not-quite-urban , not-quite-suburban milieu as to have viewers recoiling from the reality check .
148675 | 0.625 | So much facile technique , such cute ideas , so little movie .
148677 | 0.56944 | So relentlessly wholesome it made me want to swipe something .
148757 | 0.61111 | Something akin to a Japanese Alice Through the Looking Glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously .
148758 | 0.55556 | Sometimes , fond memories should stay in the past : a lesson this film teaches all too well .
148897 | 0.63889 | Succeeds in providing a disquiet world the long-dreaded completion of the Police Academy series .
148938 | 0.56944 | Sunshine State surveys the landscape and assesses the issues with a clear passion for sociology .
149059 | 0.63889 | That Zhang would make such a strainingly cute film -- with a blind orphan at its center , no less -- indicates where his ambitions have wandered .
149126 | 0.55556 | The New Guy is one of them .
149220 | 0.58333 | The attempt is courageous , even if the result is wildly uneven .
149233 | 0.54167 | The best drug addition movies are usually depressing but rewarding .
149259 | 0.52778 | The cast is uniformly excellent ... but the film itself is merely mildly charming .
149328 | 0.54167 | The element of surprise might be the only thing Femme Fatale has going for it .
149339 | 0.51389 | The ending does n't work ... but most of the movie works so well I 'm almost recommending it , anyway -- maybe not to everybody , but certainly to people with a curiosity about how a movie can go very right , and then step wrong .
149347 | 0.69444 | The episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life .
149370 | 0.54167 | The film 's bathos often overwhelms what could have been a more multifaceted look at this interesting time and place .
149373 | 0.58333 | The film 's essentially over by the meet-cute .
149421 | 0.72222 | The film is old-fashioned , occasionally charming and as subtle as boldface .
149424 | 0.69444 | The film is surprisingly well-directed by Brett Ratner , who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act .
149522 | 0.69444 | The latest installment in the Pokemon canon , Pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the Japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where Pokemon graze in peace .
149698 | 0.55556 | The pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything .
149780 | 0.63889 | The production values are up there .
149794 | 0.51389 | The rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it 's more comedy than suspense De Palma creates .
149897 | 0.625 | The structure the film takes may find Matt Damon and Ben Affleck once again looking for residuals as this officially completes a Good Will Hunting trilogy that was never planned .
149938 | 0.51389 | The title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you 'll read anywhere .
150018 | 0.69444 | Thekids will probably stay amused at the kaleidoscope of big , colorful characters .
150029 | 0.54167 | There 's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of Queen of the Damned , as its origins in an Anne Rice novel dictate , but generally , it 's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance .
150089 | 0.54167 | There are n't many laughs in this interesting study of the cultural mores of Georgian Jews in Tel Aviv .
150113 | 0.59722 | There is no insight into the anguish of Heidi 's life -- only a depiction of pain , today 's version of Greek tragedy , the talk-show guest decrying her fate .
150164 | 0.56944 | This directorial debut from music video show-off Higuchinsky is all flash .
150214 | 0.52778 | This is a good movie in spurts , but when it does n't work , it 's at important times .
150231 | 0.54167 | This is an hour and a half of daydreaming .
150246 | 0.55556 | This is really just another genre picture .
150249 | 0.58333 | This is the first full scale WWII flick from Hong Kong 's John Woo .
150258 | 0.59722 | This kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch .
150283 | 0.63889 | This one is a few bits funnier than Malle 's dud , if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like Slob City reductions of Damon Runyon crooks .
150305 | 0.51389 | This rather superficial arthouse middle-brow film knows how to please a crowd , and that 's about all it does well .
150352 | 0.63889 | Though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work .
150364 | 0.61111 | Though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen The Hunger or Cat People will find little new here , but a tasty performance from Vincent Gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary .
150388 | 0.59722 | To enjoy this movie 's sharp dialogue and delightful performance by Jolie and Burns , you have to gloss over the no sense ending .
150392 | 0.52778 | To my taste , the film 's comic characters come perilously close to being Amoses and Andys for a new generation .
150455 | 0.51389 | Too many improbabilities and rose-colored situations temper what could 've been an impacting film .
150622 | 0.56944 | Van Wilder does n't bring anything new to the proverbial table , but it does possess a coherence absent in recent crass-a-thons like Tomcats , Freddy Got Fingered , and Slackers .
150693 | 0.54167 | Walter Hill 's pulpy , stylized boxing melodrama Undisputed nearly overcomes its questionable in-the-ring match-up with solid fight choreography and gritty prison authenticity .
150744 | 0.84722 | We have n't seen such hilarity since Say It Is n't So !
150747 | 0.59722 | We may never think of band camp as a geeky or nerdy thing again .
150755 | 0.56944 | Weaves a spell over you , with its disturbingly close-up look at damaged psyches and its subtle undercurrents of danger .
150821 | 0.51389 | What begins as a seemingly brainless , bubbly romantic comedy becomes a cliche-drenched melodrama by mid-film and , by film 's end , a feminist action fantasy .
150852 | 0.58333 | What would Jesus do if He was a film director ?
150859 | 0.63889 | Whatever Eyre 's failings as a dramatist , he deserves credit for bringing audiences into this hard and bitter place .
150863 | 0.55556 | When Perry fists a bull at the Moore Farm , it 's only a matter of time before he gets the upper hand in matters of the heart .
150916 | 0.58333 | While it 's nice to watch a movie that has n't been focus-grouped into tedium , Yu 's cinematic alchemy produces nearly as much lead as gold .
150935 | 0.61111 | While there 's something intrinsically funny about Sir Anthony Hopkins saying ` Get in the car , bitch , ' this Jerry Bruckheimer production has little else to offer
150941 | 0.52778 | Who needs love like this ?
150954 | 0.625 | Will give many ministers and Bible-study groups hours of material to discuss .
150966 | 0.58333 | William Shatner , as a pompous professor , is the sole bright spot ...
150997 | 0.79167 | With Danilo Donati 's witty designs and Dante Spinotti 's luscious cinematography , this might have made a decent children 's movie -- if only Benigni had n't insisted on casting himself in the title role .
151098 | 0.58333 | Yes , one enjoys seeing Joan grow from awkward young woman to strong , determined monarch , but her love for the philandering Philip only diminishes her stature .
151102 | 0.63889 | Yes .
151131 | 0.55556 | You end up simply admiring this bit or that , this performance or that .
151159 | 0.59722 | Your appreciation of it will depend on what experiences you bring to it and what associations you choose to make .
151176 | 0.58333 | Ze movie starts out so funny , then she is nothing .
151193 | 0.56944 | ` A ' for creativity but comes across more as a sketch for a full-length comedy .
151212 | 0.55556 | ` How many more voyages can this limping but dearly-loved franchise survive ? '
157817 | 0.625 | does paint some memorable images ... , but Makhmalbaf keeps her distance from the characters
168797 | 0.51389 | perfectly enjoyable , instantly forgettable , nothing to write home about .
181502 | 0.52778 | A Meatballs for the bare-midriff generation .
181538 | 0.80556 | A bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception , which , while it may not rival the filmmaker 's period pieces , is still very much worth seeing .
181674 | 0.59722 | A few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , but the wheezing terrorist subplot has n't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , and the protagonists ' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun .
181692 | 0.63889 | A film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , Waiting for Happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact .
181703 | 0.68056 | A formula family tearjerker told with a heavy Irish brogue ... accentuating , rather than muting , the plot 's saccharine thrust .
181715 | 0.58333 | A glossy knock-off of a B-movie revenge flick .
181718 | 0.51389 | A good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance .
181785 | 0.65278 | A live-action cartoon , a fast-moving and cheerfully simplistic 88 minutes of exaggerated action put together with the preteen boy in mind .
181839 | 0.52778 | A modestly comic , modestly action-oriented World War II adventure that , in terms of authenticity , is one of those films that requires the enemy to never shoot straight .
181854 | 0.51389 | A movie that seems motivated more by a desire to match mortarboards with Dead Poets Society and Good Will Hunting than by its own story .
181912 | 0.51389 | A preposterously melodramatic paean to gang-member teens in Brooklyn circa 1958 .
181936 | 0.69444 | A quaint , romanticized rendering .

185206 | 0.875 | It 's refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy ; Diesel , with his brawny frame and cool , composed delivery , fits the bill perfectly .
185227 | 0.97222 | It 's the funniest American comedy since Graffiti Bridge .
185229 | 0.88889 | It 's the kind of movie that , aside from Robert Altman , Spike Lee , the Coen Brothers and a few others , our moviemakers do n't make often enough .
185282 | 0.72222 | It goes down easy , leaving virtually no aftertaste .
185326 | 0.61111 | It never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time .
185411 | 0.58333 | Its strengths and weaknesses play off each other virtually to a stand-off , with the unfortunate trump card being the dreary mid-section of the film .
185506 | 0.56944 | Jonah is only so-so ... the addition of a biblical message will either improve the film for you , or it will lessen it .
185529 | 0.61111 | Juliette Binoche 's Sand is vivacious , but it 's hard to sense that powerhouse of 19th-century prose behind her childlike smile .

185589 | 0.65278 | Ken Russell would love this .

186331 | 0.79167 | Nice piece of work .
186339 | 0.625 | Nicks refuses to let Slackers be seen as just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy .
186378 | 0.625 | No doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place .
186428 | 0.51389 | Not a bad premise , but the execution is lackluster at best .
186430 | 0.79167 | Not a schlocky creature feature but something far more stylish and cerebral -- and , hence , more chillingly effective .
186496 | 0.58333 | Observant intelligence constantly vies with pretension -- and sometimes plain wacky implausibility -- throughout Maelstrom .
186513 | 0.72222 | Often likable , but just as often it 's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy .
186673 | 0.54167 | Perhaps the most annoying thing about Who Is Cletis Tout ?
186719 | 0.56944 | Plods along , minus the twisted humor and eye-popping visuals that have made Miike ... a cult hero .
186760 | 0.65278 | Predictable and cloying , though Brown Sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle .
186846 | 0.52778 | Ram Dass Fierce Grace moulds itself as an example to up-and-coming documentarians , of the overlooked pitfalls of such an endeavour .
186863 | 0.56944 | Really dumb but occasionally really funny .
186903 | 0.51389 | Represents something very close to the nadir of the thriller\/horror genre .

187167 | 0.51389 | Screenwriter Chris ver Weil 's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability .
187169 | 0.68056 | Screenwriter Dan Schneider and director Shawn Levy substitute volume and primary colors for humor and bite .
187180 | 0.63889 | Seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director 's experiment is a successful one .
187239 | 0.58333 | Shanghai Ghetto should be applauded for finding a new angle on a tireless story , but you might want to think twice before booking passage .

187416 | 0.65278 | Some Body is a shaky , uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves .
187507 | 0.79167 | Spirit is a visual treat , and it takes chances that are bold by studio standards , but it lacks a strong narrative .
187580 | 0.72222 | Still , the updated Dickensian sensibility of writer Craig Bartlett 's story is appealing .
187598 | 0.51389 | Strident and inelegant in its ` message-movie ' posturing .
187653 | 0.51389 | Swimfan , like Fatal Attraction , eventually goes overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool substitutes for a bathtub .

187859 | 0.54167 | The Santa Clause 2 is a barely adequate babysitter for older kids , but I 've got to give it thumbs down .
187977 | 0.51389 | The beautiful , unusual music is this film 's chief draw , but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep .
187979 | 0.72222 | The best thing about the movie is its personable , amusing cast .
187991 | 0.69444 | The bottom line with Nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series : Fans will undoubtedly enjoy it , and the uncommitted need n't waste their time on it .
187997 | 0.625 | The campy results make Mel Brooks ' Borscht Belt schtick look sophisticated .

188092 | 0.51389 | The entire movie is filled with deja vu moments .
188115 | 0.61111 | The exploitative , clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors .
188149 | 0.51389 | The film 's stagecrafts are intimate and therefore bolder than the otherwise calculated artifice that defines and overwhelms the film 's production design .
188165 | 0.63889 | The film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances , but the result is disappointing .
188174 | 0.54167 | The film did n't move me one way or the other , but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due .
188190 | 0.52778 | The film has too many spots where it 's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that 's especially fit for the kiddies .
188214 | 0.51389 | The film tries to touch on spousal abuse but veers off course and becomes just another revenge film .
188220 | 0.59722 | The filmmaker 's heart is in the right place ...

188380 | 0.58333 | The movie 's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating , though , even if the movie itself does n't stand a ghost of a chance .
188382 | 0.52778 | The movie 's heavy-handed screenplay navigates a fast fade into pomposity and pretentiousness .
188413 | 0.58333 | The movie certainly has its share of clever moments and biting dialogue , but there 's just not much lurking below its abstract surface .
188414 | 0.52778 | The movie does has some entertainment value - how much depends on how well you like Chris Rock .

189028 | 0.58333 | This is the first film I 've ever seen that had no obvious directing involved .
189139 | 0.72222 | Though its rather routine script is loaded with familiar situations , the movie has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should .

189692 | 0.69444 | While it may not add up to the sum of its parts , Holofcener 's film offers just enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded , and the ensemble cast is engaging enough to keep you from shifting in your chair too often .
189696 | 0.73611 | While the material is slight , the movie is better than you might think .

224169 | 0.65278 | It 's endearing to hear Madame D. refer to her husband as ` Jackie ' -- and he does make for excellent company , not least as a self-conscious performer .
224173 | 0.73611 | It 's far from a frothy piece , and the characters are complex , laden with plenty of baggage and tinged with tragic undertones .
224175 | 0.625 | It 's fun , but it 's a real howler .
224176 | 0.72222 | It 's funny .
224184 | 0.68056 | It 's hard to imagine anybody ever being `` in the mood '' to view a movie as harrowing and painful as The Grey Zone , but it 's equally hard to imagine anybody being able to tear their eyes away from the screen once it 's started .
224187 | 0.66667 | It 's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles , but Notorious C.H.O. still feels like a promising work-in-progress .
224190 | 0.66667 | It 's incredible the number of stories the Holocaust has generated .
224203 | 0.58333 | It 's likely that whatever you thought of the first production -- pro or con -- you 'll likely think of this one .
224213 | 0.68056 | It 's not just a feel-good movie , it 's a feel movie .
224218 | 0.56944 | It 's not life-affirming -- its vulgar and mean , but I liked it .
224219 | 0.58333 | It 's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie .
224220 | 0.68056 | It 's not too fast and not too slow .
224223 | 0.59722 | It 's not too racy and it 's not too offensive .
224229 | 0.91667 | It 's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message , so it 's great for the kids .
224233 | 0.70833 | It 's probably worth catching solely on its visual merits .
224234 | 0.58333 | It 's quite another to feel physically caught up in the process .
224238 | 0.79167 | It 's so good that its relentless , polished wit can withstand not only inept school productions , but even Oliver Parker 's movie adaptation .
224242 | 0.66667 | It 's sort of in-between , and it works .
224247 | 0.70833 | It 's sweet .
224253 | 0.875 | It 's the chemistry between the women and the droll scene-stealing wit and wolfish pessimism of Anna Chancellor that makes this `` Two Weddings and a Funeral '' fun .
224255 | 0.58333 | It 's the perfect kind of film to see when you do n't want to use your brain .
224256 | 0.77778 | It 's the sweet Cinderella story that `` Pretty Woman '' wanted to be .
224257 | 0.59722 | It 's time to let your hair down -- Greek style .
224263 | 0.625 | It 's too harsh to work as a piece of storytelling , but as an intellectual exercise -- an unpleasant debate that 's been given the drive of a narrative and that 's been acted out -- The Believer is nothing less than a provocative piece of work .
224264 | 0.79167 | It 's touching and tender and proves that even in sorrow you can find humor .
224266 | 0.54167 | It 's unnerving to see Recoing 's bizzarre reaction to his unemployment .
224268 | 0.625 | It 's usually a bad sign when directors abandon their scripts and go where the moment takes them , but Olympia , Wash. , based filmmakers Anne de Marcken and Marilyn Freeman did just that and it 's what makes their project so interesting .
224270 | 0.56944 | It bites hard .
224273 | 0.55556 | It ca n't escape its past , and it does n't want to .
224276 | 0.81944 | It cuts to the core of what it actually means to face your fears , to be a girl in a world of boys , to be a boy truly in love with a girl , and to ride the big metaphorical wave that is life -- wherever it takes you .
224285 | 0.52778 | It does n't quite deserve the gong , but there are more fascinating acts than `` Confessions of a Dangerous Mind . ''
224289 | 0.61111 | It does n't reach them , but the effort is gratefully received .
224291 | 0.70833 | It does succeed by following a feel-good formula with a winning style , and by offering its target audience of urban kids some welcome role models and optimism .
224296 | 0.72222 | It falls far short of poetry , but it 's not bad prose .
224308 | 0.81944 | It has fun with the quirks of family life , but it also treats the subject with fondness and respect .
224313 | 0.75 | It has plenty of laughs .
224315 | 0.81944 | It haunts , horrifies , startles and fascinates ; it is impossible to look away .
224326 | 0.83333 | It is , however , a completely honest , open-hearted film that should appeal to anyone willing to succumb to it .
224327 | 0.875 | It is a kickass , dense sci-fi action thriller hybrid that delivers and then some .
224328 | 0.59722 | It is a movie about passion .
224332 | 0.63889 | It is about irrational , unexplainable life and it seems so real because it does not attempt to filter out the complexity .
224337 | 0.55556 | It is not what you see , it is what you think you see .
224367 | 0.75 | It may not be a huge cut of above the rest , but I enjoyed Barbershop .
224368 | 0.55556 | It may not be as cutting , as witty or as true as back in the glory days of Weekend and Two or Three Things I Know About Her , but who else engaged in filmmaking today is so cognizant of the cultural and moral issues involved in the process ?
224369 | 0.52778 | It may not be history -- but then again , what if it is ?
224374 | 0.75 | It may scream low budget , but this charmer has a spirit that can not be denied .
224380 | 0.79167 | It might be tempting to regard Mr. Andrew and his collaborators as oddballs , but Mr. Earnhart 's quizzical , charming movie allows us to see them , finally , as artists .
224386 | 0.61111 | It puts Washington , as honest working man John Q. Archibald , on a pedestal , then keeps lifting the pedestal higher .
224387 | 0.66667 | It really is a shame that more wo n't get an opportunity to embrace small , sweet ` Evelyn . '
224392 | 0.75 | It strikes hardest ... when it reminds you how pertinent its dynamics remain .
224395 | 0.63889 | It throws quirky characters , odd situations , and off-kilter dialogue at us , all as if to say , `` Look at this !
224402 | 0.52778 | It wo n't harm anyone , but neither can I think of a very good reason to rush right out and see it .
224410 | 0.77778 | Its flame-like , roiling black-and-white inspires trembling and gratitude .
224428 | 0.625 | J. Lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie , although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear : She 's a pretty woman , but she 's no working girl .
224481 | 0.91667 | Jones ... makes a great impression as the writer-director of this little $ 1.8 million charmer , which may not be cutting-edge indie filmmaking but has a huge heart .
224489 | 0.72222 | Judging by those standards , ` Scratch ' is a pretty decent little documentary .
224494 | 0.625 | Just bring on the Battle Bots , please !
224499 | 0.83333 | Just like a splendid meal , Red Dragon satisfies -- from its ripe recipe , inspiring ingredients , certified cuisine and palatable presentation .
224508 | 0.875 | Just the labour involved in creating the layered richness of the imagery in this chiaroscuro of madness and light is astonishing .
224509 | 0.58333 | Just watch Bettany strut his stuff .
224510 | 0.73611 | Just when you think that every possible angle has been exhausted by documentarians , another new film emerges with yet another remarkable yet shockingly little-known perspective .
224521 | 0.79167 | Keenly observed and refreshingly natural , Swimming gets the details right , from its promenade of barely clad bodies in Myrtle Beach , S.C. , to the adrenaline jolt of a sudden lunch rush at the diner .
224532 | 0.94444 | Kids five and up will be delighted with the fast , funny , and even touching story .
224533 | 0.61111 | Kids who are into this Thornberry stuff will probably be in wedgie heaven .
224552 | 0.88889 | LaBute masterfully balances both Traditional or Modern stories together in a manner that one never overwhelms the other .
224563 | 0.61111 | Large budget notwithstanding , the movie is such a blip on the year 's radar screen that it 's tempting just to go with it for the ride .
224594 | 0.80556 | Leigh is one of the rare directors who feels acting is the heart and soul of cinema .
224612 | 0.86111 | Light , silly , photographed with colour and depth , and rather a good time .
224613 | 0.61111 | Light years \/ several warp speeds \/ levels and levels of dilithium crystals better than the pitiful Insurrection .
224617 | 0.69444 | Lightweight but appealing .
224622 | 0.77778 | Like The English Patient and The Unbearable Lightness of Being , The Hours is one of those reputedly `` unfilmable '' novels that has bucked the odds to emerge as an exquisite motion picture in its own right .
224624 | 0.59722 | Like a less dizzily gorgeous companion to Mr. Wong 's In the Mood for Love -- very much a Hong Kong movie despite its mainland setting .
224634 | 0.93056 | Like blended shades of lipstick , these components combine into one terrific story with lots of laughs .
224635 | 0.625 | Like its parade of predecessors , this Halloween is a gory slash-fest .
224642 | 0.625 | Likely to have decades of life as a classic movie franchise ?
224655 | 0.93056 | Looking aristocratic , luminous yet careworn in Jane Hamilton 's exemplary costumes , Rampling gives a performance that could not be improved upon . '
224663 | 0.76389 | Lovely and Amazing is Holofcener 's deep , uncompromising curtsy to women she knows , and very likely is .
224665 | 0.54167 | Lucas , take notes .
224673 | 0.83333 | Lux , now in her eighties , does a great combination act as narrator , Jewish grandmother and subject -- taking us through a film that is part biography , part entertainment and part history .
224683 | 0.83333 | MY LITTLE EYE is the best little `` horror '' movie I 've seen in years .
224699 | 0.90278 | Maggie G. makes an amazing breakthrough in her first starring role and eats up the screen .
224703 | 0.52778 | Make no mistake , ivans xtc .
224716 | 0.52778 | Mandel Holland 's direction is uninspired , and his scripting unsurprising , but the performances by Phifer and Black are ultimately winning .
224725 | 0.79167 | Many insightful moments .
224741 | 0.68056 | Matters play out realistically if not always fairly .
224745 | 0.65278 | May be spoofing an easy target -- those old ' 50 's giant creature features -- but ... it acknowledges and celebrates their cheesiness as the reason why people get a kick out of watching them today .
224748 | 0.625 | Maybe he was reading the minds of the audience .
224751 | 0.81944 | Maybe not a classic , but a movie the kids will want to see over and over again .
224758 | 0.65278 | Me no lika da accents so good , but I thoroughly enjoyed the love story .
224781 | 0.66667 | Mention `` Solaris '' five years from now and I 'm sure those who saw it will have an opinion to share .
224784 | 0.61111 | Message movie or an action-packed submarine spectacular ?
224795 | 0.84722 | Mike White 's deft combination of serious subject matter and dark , funny humor make `` The Good Girl '' a film worth watching .
224798 | 0.59722 | Mildly amusing .
224805 | 0.58333 | Mocking kung fu pictures when they were a staple of exploitation theater programming was witty .
224814 | 0.94444 | Moore provides an invaluable service by sparking debate and encouraging thought .
224817 | 0.84722 | More intimate than spectacular , E.T. is carried less by wow factors than by its funny , moving yarn that holds up well after two decades .
224823 | 0.88889 | More mature than Fatal Attraction , more complete than Indecent Proposal and more relevant than 9 1\/2 Weeks , Unfaithful is at once intimate and universal cinema .
224828 | 0.80556 | Morvern rocks .
224830 | 0.83333 | Most haunting about `` Fence '' is its conclusion , when we hear the ultimate fate of these girls and realize , much to our dismay , that this really did happen .
224831 | 0.66667 | Most new movies have a bright sheen .
224835 | 0.68056 | Most thrillers send audiences out talking about specific scary scenes or startling moments ; `` Frailty '' leaves us with the terrifying message that the real horror may be waiting for us at home .
224840 | 0.58333 | Mostly Martha could have used a little trimming -- 10 or 15 minutes could be cut and no one would notice -- but it 's a pleasurable trifle .
224847 | 0.88889 | Moving and vibrant .
224867 | 0.80556 | Mr. Caine and Mr. Fraser are the whole show here , with their memorable and resourceful performances .
224882 | 0.79167 | Mr. Clooney , Mr. Kaufman and all their collaborators are entitled to take a deep bow for fashioning an engrossing entertainment out of an almost sure-fire prescription for a critical and commercial disaster .
224894 | 0.81944 | Mr. Deeds is , as comedy goes , very silly -- and in the best way .
224896 | 0.83333 | Mr. Deeds is sure to give you a lot of laughs in this simple , sweet and romantic comedy .
224930 | 0.83333 | Mr. Koshashvili is a director to watch .
224949 | 0.93056 | Mr. Parker has brilliantly updated his source and grasped its essence , composing a sorrowful and hilarious tone poem about alienated labor , or an absurdist workplace sitcom .
224957 | 0.72222 | Mr. Polanski is in his element here : alone , abandoned , but still consoled by his art , which is more than he has ever revealed before about the source of his spiritual survival .
224974 | 0.77778 | Mr. Scorsese 's bravery and integrity in advancing this vision can hardly be underestimated .
224988 | 0.72222 | Mr. Spielberg and his company just want you to enjoy yourselves without feeling conned .
224996 | 0.83333 | Mr. Tsai is a very original artist in his medium , and What Time Is It There ?
225000 | 0.76389 | Mr. Wedge and Mr. Saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well .
225019 | 0.625 | Ms. Fulford-Wierzbicki is almost spooky in her sulky , calculating Lolita turn .
225023 | 0.84722 | Ms. Hutchins is talented enough and charismatic enough to make us care about Zelda 's ultimate fate .
225043 | 0.80556 | Ms. Seigner and Mr. Serrault bring fresh , unforced naturalism to their characters .
225056 | 0.83333 | Much of it comes from the brave , uninhibited performances by its lead actors .
225060 | 0.76389 | Much of it is funny , but there are also some startling , surrealistic moments ...
225061 | 0.73611 | Much of the movie 's charm lies in the utter cuteness of Stuart and Margolo .
225062 | 0.81944 | Much of the way , though , this is a refreshingly novel ride .
225070 | 0.76389 | Munch 's screenplay is tenderly observant of his characters .
225072 | 0.83333 | Must-see viewing for anyone involved in the high-tech industry .
225089 | 0.56944 | Nachtwey clears the cynicism right out of you .
225099 | 0.75 | Neatly constructed thriller .
225102 | 0.51389 | Neither a rousing success nor a blinding embarrassment .
225103 | 0.625 | Neither the funniest film that Eddie Murphy nor Robert De Niro has ever made , Showtime is nevertheless efficiently amusing for a good while .
225106 | 0.73611 | Nettelbeck has crafted an engaging fantasy of flavours and emotions , one part romance novel , one part recipe book .
225112 | 0.65278 | Never once predictable .
225128 | 0.88889 | Nicholson 's understated performance is wonderful .
225135 | 0.77778 | Nicole Holofcenter , the insightful writer\/director responsible for this illuminating comedy does n't wrap the proceedings up neatly but the ideas tie together beautifully .
225141 | 0.70833 | No , I love it ... hell , I dunno .
225154 | 0.94444 | No Such Thing is sort of a minimalist Beauty and the Beast , but in this case the Beast should definitely get top billing .
225163 | 0.51389 | No one goes unindicted here , which is probably for the best .
225174 | 0.51389 | None of this has the suavity or classical familiarity of Bond , but much of it is good for a laugh .
225195 | 0.61111 | Not everything in this ambitious comic escapade works , but Coppola , along with his sister , Sofia , is a real filmmaker .
225202 | 0.83333 | Not only are the special effects and narrative flow much improved , and Daniel Radcliffe more emotionally assertive this time around as Harry , but the film conjures the magic of author J.K. Rowling 's books .
225209 | 0.55556 | Not to mention a sharper , cleaner camera lens .
225210 | 0.80556 | Not to mention absolutely refreshed .
225213 | 0.52778 | Nothing is black and white .
225217 | 0.68056 | Nothing overly original , mind you , but solidly entertaining .
225234 | 0.73611 | Notwithstanding my problem with the movie 's final half hour , I 'm going to recommend SECRETARY , based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by Spader and Gyllenhaal , and also the unique way Shainberg goes about telling what at heart is a sweet little girl -
225270 | 0.76389 | Oddly compelling .
225280 | 0.77778 | Often hilarious .
225283 | 0.55556 | Oh , and Booty Call .
225284 | 0.66667 | Oh , and more entertaining , too .
225285 | 0.59722 | Oh , it 's extreme , all right .
225286 | 0.66667 | Oh , look at that clever angle !
225296 | 0.80556 | On that score , the film certainly does n't disappoint .
225298 | 0.76389 | Once folks started hanging out at the barbershop , they never wanted to leave .
225309 | 0.83333 | One of the best of the year .

225323 | 0.90278 | One-of-a-kind near-masterpiece .
