18694 | 0.86111 | As Weber and Weissman demonstrate with such insight and celebratory verve , the Cockettes were n't as much about gender , sexual preference or political agitprop as they were simply a triumph of the indomitable human will to rebel , connect and create .

18992 | 0.84722 | It 's a terrific American sports movie and Dennis Quaid is its athletic heart .
18993 | 0.83333 | It 's almost impossible not to be moved by the movie 's depiction of sacrifice and its stirring epilogue in post-Soviet Russia .
18994 | 0.83333 | It 's amazingly perceptive in its subtle , supportive but unsentimental look at the Marks family .
18995 | 0.72222 | It 's not so much enjoyable to watch as it is enlightening to listen to new sides of a previous reality , and to visit with some of the people who were able to make an impact in the theater world .
18996 | 0.81944 | It 's one of the saddest films I have ever seen that still manages to be uplifting but not overly sentimental .
18998 | 0.97222 | It 's rare to find a film that dazzles the eye , challenges the brain , AND satisfies our lust for fast-paced action , but Minority Report delivers all that and a whole lot more .

19000 | 0.69444 | It 's still worth a look .
19002 | 0.875 | It could change America , not only because it is full of necessary discussion points , but because it is so accessible that it makes complex politics understandable to viewers looking for nothing but energetic entertainment .
19003 | 0.5 | It is now .
19004 | 0.88889 | It represents better-than-average movie-making that does n't demand a dumb , distracted audience .
19005 | 0.59722 | It ultimately stands forth as an important chronicle of the abuses of one of Latin America 's most oppressive regimes .
19007 | 0.77778 | It uses an old-time formula , it 's not terribly original and it 's rather messy -- but you just have to love the big , dumb , happy movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding .
19009 | 0.45833 | It would be interesting to hear from the other side , but in Talk to Her , the women are down for the count .
19015 | 0.61111 | Its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar , but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and , at the same time , is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time .
19019 | 0.79167 | Jacquot 's Tosca is a treat .
19033 | 0.5 | Just what makes us happy , anyway ?
19037 | 0.66667 | Kaufman creates an eerie sense of not only being there at the time of these events but the very night Matthew was killed .

19057 | 0.76389 | Longley has constructed a remarkably coherent , horrifically vivid snapshot of those turbulent days .
19098 | 0.84722 | Moore 's complex and important film is also , believe it or not , immensely entertaining , a David and Goliath story that 's still very much playing itself out .
19100 | 0.68056 | Moore 's performance impresses almost as much as her work with Haynes in 1995 's Safe .
19103 | 0.94444 | Morton is , as usual , brilliant .
19105 | 0.80556 | Most impressive , though , is the film 's open-ended finale that refuses to entirely close its characters ' emotional wounds .
19118 | 0.90278 | Murderous Maids may well be the most comprehensive of these films and also strike closest to the truth .
19129 | 0.22222 | Nearly surreal , dabbling in French , this is no simple movie , and you 'll be taking a risk if you choose to see it .
19132 | 0.29167 | Never mind whether you buy the stuff about Barris being a CIA hit man .
19137 | 0.70833 | Nicely serves as an examination of a society in transition .
19148 | 0.77778 | Now trimmed by about 20 minutes , this lavish three-year-old production has enough grandeur and scale to satisfy as grown-up escapism .
19157 | 0.875 | Often gruelling and heartbreaking to witness , but Seldahl and Wollter 's sterling performances raise this far above the level of the usual maudlin disease movie .
19160 | 0.30556 | One Hour Photo is an intriguing snapshot of one man and his delusions ; it 's just too bad it does n't have more flashes of insight .
19161 | 0.97222 | One of the greatest romantic comedies of the past decade .
19165 | 0.58333 | Over-the-top and a bit ostentatious , this is a movie that 's got oodles of style and substance .
19167 | 0.90278 | Parker holds true to Wilde 's own vision of a pure comedy with absolutely no meaning , and no desire to be anything but a polished , sophisticated entertainment that is in love with its own cleverness .
19192 | 0.77778 | Presents an astute appraisal of Middle American musical torpor and the desperate struggle to escape it .
19195 | 0.83333 | Provides an intriguing window into the imagination and hermetic analysis of Todd Solondz .
19215 | 0.80556 | Remarkably accessible and affecting .
19220 | 0.91667 | Renner 's performance as Dahmer is unforgettable , deeply absorbing .
19227 | 0.63889 | Roman Coppola may never become the filmmaker his Dad was , but heck -- few filmmakers will .
19230 | 0.83333 | Romanek keeps the film constantly taut ... reflecting the character 's instability with a metaphorical visual style and an unnerving , heartbeat-like score .
19255 | 0.84722 | Somewhat blurred , but Kinnear 's performance is razor sharp .
19257 | 0.54167 | Spielberg is the rare director who does not want to invite viewers to gawk at or applaud his special effects .
19262 | 0.76389 | Star Wars is back in a major way .
19264 | 0.22222 | Starts off with a bang , but then fizzles like a wet stick of dynamite at the very end .
19271 | 0.68056 | Still pretentious and filled with subtext , but entertaining enough at ` face value ' to recommend to anyone looking for something different .
19283 | 0.52778 | Thankfully , the film , which skirts that rapidly deteriorating line between fantasy and reality ... takes a tongue-in-cheek attitude even as it pushes the Croc Hunter agenda .
19291 | 0.70833 | The Pianist is a fine valedictory work for Polanski , made richer by his own experiences , making his other movies somehow richer in the bargain .
19293 | 0.69444 | The Transporter is as lively and as fun as it is unapologetically dumb
19296 | 0.48611 | The additional storyline is interesting and entertaining , but it does n't have the same magical quality as the beginning of the story .
19303 | 0.81944 | The director , Steven Shainberg , has succeeded by focusing intently on his characters , making them quirky individuals rather than figures of fun .
19306 | 0.69444 | The diversity of the artists represented , both in terms of style and ethnicity , prevents the proceedings from feeling repetitious , as does the appropriately brief 40-minute running time .
19309 | 0.81944 | The film 's greatest asset is how much it 's not just another connect-the-dots , spy-on-the-run picture .
19311 | 0.86111 | The film has just enough of everything -- re-enactments , archival footage , talking-head interviews -- and the music is simply sublime .
19313 | 0.88889 | The kooky yet shadowy vision Clooney sustains throughout is daring , inventive and impressive .
19314 | 0.86111 | The movie has a soft , percolating magic , a deadpan suspense .
19315 | 0.86111 | The movie has an avalanche of eye-popping visual effects .
19318 | 0.88889 | The passions aroused by the discord between old and new cultures are set against the strange , stark beauty of the Mideast desert , so lovingly and perceptively filmed that you can almost taste the desiccated air .
19322 | 0.86111 | The people in Dogtown and Z-Boys are so funny , aggressive and alive , you have to watch them because you ca n't wait to see what they do next .
19326 | 0.81944 | The principals in this cast are all fine , but Bishop and Stevenson are standouts .
19328 | 0.875 | The result is something quite fresh and delightful .
19332 | 0.41667 | The story wraps back around on itself in the kind of elegant symmetry that 's rare in film today , but be warned : It 's a slow slog to get there .
19334 | 0.83333 | The stunning , dreamlike visuals will impress even those viewers who have little patience for Euro-film pretension .
19339 | 0.61111 | The tone is balanced , reflective and reasonable .
19342 | 0.66667 | The tug of war that ensues is as much a snapshot of modern China in microcosm as it is a crash course in movie mythology .
19345 | 0.875 | The unique tug-of-war with viewer expectations is undeniable , if not a pleasure in its own right .
19347 | 0.77778 | The whole cast looks to be having so much fun with the slapstick antics and silly street patois , tossing around obscure expressions like Bellini and Mullinski , that the compact 86 minutes breezes by .
19348 | 0.94444 | There 's a vastness implied in Metropolis that is just breathtaking .
19350 | 0.70833 | There are a few stabs at absurdist comedy ... but mostly the humor is of the sweet , gentle and occasionally cloying kind that has become an Iranian specialty .
19354 | 0.83333 | Think of it as a sort of comfort food for the mind .
19357 | 0.88889 | This bold and lyrical first feature from Raja Amari expands the pat notion that middle-aged women just wanna have fun into a rousing treatise of sensual empowerment .
19359 | 0.90278 | This clever caper movie has twists worthy of David Mamet and is enormous fun for thinking audiences .
19362 | 0.75 | This examination of aquatic life off the shores of the Baja California peninsula of Mexico offers an engrossing way to demonstrate the virtues of the IMAX format .
19363 | 0.77778 | This is a film brimming with detail and nuance and one that speaks volumes about the ability of the human spirit to find solace in events that could easily crush it forever .
19364 | 0.91667 | This is one of Polanski 's best films .
19365 | 0.79167 | This is such a dazzlingly self-assured directorial debut that it 's hard to know what to praise first .
19366 | 0.69444 | This is such a high-energy movie where the drumming and the marching are so excellent , who cares if the story 's a little weak .
19368 | 0.80556 | Those who would follow Haneke on his creepy explorations ... are rewarded by brutal , committed performances from Huppert and Magimel .
19370 | 0.69444 | Though Mama takes a bit too long to find its rhythm and a third-act plot development is somewhat melodramatic , its ribald humor and touching nostalgia are sure to please anyone in search of a Jules and Jim for the new millennium .
19372 | 0.83333 | Though of particular interest to students and enthusiast of international dance and world music , the film is designed to make viewers of all ages , cultural backgrounds and rhythmic ability want to get up and dance .
19374 | 0.48611 | Though this film can be clumsy , its ambitions are equally -- and admirably -- uncommercial .
19384 | 0.77778 | Tsai Ming-liang has taken his trademark style and refined it to a crystalline point .
19389 | 0.51389 | Ultimately , the message of Trouble Every Day seems to be that all sexual desire disrupts life 's stasis .
19392 | 0.51389 | Using his audience as a figurative port-of-call , Dong pulls his even-handed ideological ship to their dock for unloading , before he continues his longer journey still ahead .
19401 | 0.91667 | Visits spy-movie territory like a novel you ca n't put down , examines a footnote to history seldom brought to light on the screen , and keeps you guessing from first frame to last .
19406 | 0.625 | We get some truly unique character studies and a cross-section of Americana that Hollywood could n't possibly fictionalize and be believed .
19414 | 0.73611 | What 's most striking about this largely celebratory film ... is the sense of isolation that permeates these bastions of individuality in an Ikea world .
19418 | 0.80556 | While not all transitions to adulthood are so fraught , there 's much truth and no small amount of poetry in Girls Ca n't Swim .
19424 | 0.70833 | Who knows what exactly Godard is on about in this film , but his words and images do n't have to add up to mesmerize you .

19444 | 0.55556 | You could say that it 's slow at times , you could say that a few of the characters act in ways that real people would n't , but one thing you could n't say is that Alias Betty is predictable .

25982 | 0.38889 | Like a south-of-the-border Melrose Place .
25984 | 0.375 | Like its two predecessors , 1983 's Koyaanisqatsi and 1988 's Powaqqatsi , the cinematic collage Naqoyqatsi could be the most navel-gazing film ever .
25986 | 0.72222 | Like old myths and wonder tales spun afresh .
25994 | 0.43056 | Lilia 's transformation from strict mother to sensual siren is superficially preposterous , but Abbas infuses the role with an unimpeachable core of emotional truth .

65819 | 0.88889 | Good performances and a realistic , non-exploitive approach make Paid in Full worth seeing .
65826 | 0.63889 | Gooding is the energetic frontman , and it 's hard to resist his enthusiasm , even if the filmmakers come up with nothing original in the way of slapstick sequences .
65836 | 0.93056 | Gosling creates a staggeringly compelling character , a young man whose sharp intellect is at the very root of his contradictory , self-hating , self-destructive ways .
65841 | 0.72222 | Graham Greene 's novel of colonialism and empire is elevated by Michael Caine 's performance as a weary journalist in a changing world .
65844 | 0.45833 | Grainy photography mars an otherwise delightful comedy of errors .
65854 | 0.73611 | Great fun both for sports aficionados and for ordinary louts whose idea of exercise is climbing the steps of a stadium-seat megaplex .
65857 | 0.86111 | Great over-the-top moviemaking if you 're in a slap-happy mood .
65886 | 0.80556 | Hailed as a clever exercise in neo-Hitchcockianism , this clever and very satisfying picture is more accurately Chabrolian .
65888 | 0.43056 | Halloween : Resurrection is n't exactly quality cinema , but it is n't nearly as terrible as it cold have been .
65894 | 0.73611 | Handsome and sophisticated approach to the workplace romantic comedy .
65910 | 0.80556 | Hard , endearing , caring , warm .

65930 | 0.76389 | Has the capability of effecting change and inspiring hope .
65936 | 0.66667 | Hashiguchi uses the situation to evoke a Japan bustling atop an undercurrent of loneliness and isolation .
65937 | 0.77778 | Hashiguchi vividly captures the way young Japanese live now , chafing against their culture 's manic mix of millennial brusqueness and undying , traditional politesse .
65942 | 0.68056 | Hatfield and Hicks make the oddest of couples , and in this sense the movie becomes a study of the gambles of the publishing world , offering a case study that exists apart from all the movie 's political ramifications .
65944 | 0.75 | Hatosy ... portrays young Brendan with his usual intelligence and subtlety , not to mention a convincing brogue .
65948 | 0.97222 | Hawn and Sarandon form an acting bond that makes The Banger Sisters a fascinating character study with laughs to spare .

65987 | 0.76389 | Highly recommended as an engrossing story about a horrifying historical event and the elements which contributed to it .
65988 | 0.95833 | Highly recommended viewing for its courage , ideas , technical proficiency and great acting .
65997 | 0.80556 | His work with actors is particularly impressive .
66038 | 0.75 | Holm does his sly , intricate magic , and Iben Hjelje is entirely appealing as Pumpkin .
66043 | 0.84722 | Holofcener rejects patent solutions to dramatize life 's messiness from inside out , in all its strange quirks .
66056 | 0.66667 | Horns and Halos benefits from serendipity but also reminds us of our own responsibility to question what is told as the truth .
66064 | 0.66667 | How good this film might be , depends if you believe that the shocking conclusion is too much of a plunge or not .
66072 | 0.94444 | Hugely entertaining from start to finish , featuring a fall from grace that still leaves shockwaves , it will gratify anyone who has ever suspected Hollywood of being overrun by corrupt and hedonistic weasels .
66084 | 0.93056 | Huppert and Girardot give performances of exceptional honesty .
66090 | 0.75 | I 'd be lying if I said my ribcage did n't ache by the end of Kung Pow .
66094 | 0.83333 | I 'd watch these two together again in a New York minute .
66102 | 0.55556 | I 'll put it this way : If you 're in the mood for a melodrama narrated by talking fish , this is the movie for you .
66106 | 0.22222 | I 'll stay with the stage versions , however , which bite cleaner , and deeper .
66114 | 0.45833 | I 'm not generally a fan of vegetables but this batch is pretty cute .
66119 | 0.79167 | I 'm sure mainstream audiences will be baffled , but , for those with at least a minimal appreciation of Woolf and Clarissa Dalloway , The Hours represents two of those well spent .
66126 | 0.81944 | I 've never seen or heard anything quite like this film , and I recommend it for its originality alone .
66128 | 0.73611 | I admire the closing scenes of the film , which seem to ask whether our civilization offers a cure for Vincent 's complaint .
66130 | 0.80556 | I am highly amused by the idea that we have come to a point in society where it has been deemed important enough to make a film in which someone has to be hired to portray Richard Dawson .
66131 | 0.22222 | I am more offended by his lack of faith in his audience than by anything on display here .
66137 | 0.65278 | I could n't recommend this film more .
66139 | 0.72222 | I do n't feel the least bit ashamed in admitting that my enjoyment came at the expense of seeing justice served , even if it 's a dish that 's best served cold .
66144 | 0.66667 | I do n't know if Frailty will turn Bill Paxton into an A-list director , but he can rest contentedly with the knowledge that he 's made at least one damn fine horror movie .
66145 | 0.31944 | I do n't think most of the people who loved the 1989 Paradiso will prefer this new version .
66155 | 0.59722 | I found myself liking the film , though in this case one man 's treasure could prove to be another man 's garbage .
66157 | 0.88889 | I had more fun watching Spy than I had with most of the big summer movies .
66163 | 0.72222 | I have always appreciated a smartly written motion picture , and , whatever flaws Igby Goes Down may possess , it is undeniably that .
66166 | 0.93056 | I have n't laughed that hard in years !
66170 | 0.88889 | I hope the movie is widely seen and debated with appropriate ferocity and thoughtfulness .
66175 | 0.72222 | I know I should n't have laughed , but hey , those farts got to my inner nine-year-old .
66176 | 0.61111 | I know that I 'll never listen to Marvin Gaye or the Supremes the same way again
66178 | 0.76389 | I like it .
66180 | 0.72222 | I like that Smith , he 's not making fun of these people , he 's not laughing at them .

66205 | 0.77778 | I simply ca n't recommend it enough .
66212 | 0.625 | I was impressed by how many tit-for-tat retaliatory responses the filmmakers allow before pulling the plug on the conspirators and averting an American-Russian Armageddon .
66223 | 0.625 | Ian Holm conquers France as an earthy Napoleon
66238 | 0.34722 | If Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood suffers from a ploddingly melodramatic structure , it comes to life in the performances .
66240 | 0.63889 | If Mostly Martha is mostly unsurprising , it 's still a sweet , even delectable diversion .
66242 | 0.54167 | If Reno is to the left of liberal on the political spectrum , her tough , funny , rather chaotic show is n't subversive so much as it is nit-picky about the hypocrisies of our time .
66244 | 0.65278 | If a big musical number like ` Praise the Lord , He 's the God of Second Chances ' does n't put you off , this will be an enjoyable choice for younger kids .
66246 | 0.88889 | If a horror movie 's primary goal is to frighten and disturb , then They works spectacularly well ... A shiver-inducing , nerve-rattling ride .
66248 | 0.83333 | If anything , the film is doing something of a public service -- shedding light on a group of extremely talented musicians who might otherwise go unnoticed and underappreciated by music fans .
66250 | 0.75 | If cinema had been around to capture the chaos of France in the 1790 's , one imagines the result would look like something like this .
66252 | 0.56944 | If horses could fly , this is surely what they 'd look like .
66256 | 0.65278 | If the film fails to fulfill its own ambitious goals , it nonetheless sustains interest during the long build-up of expository material .
66261 | 0.75 | If the film has a problem , its shortness disappoints : You want the story to go on and on .
66263 | 0.58333 | If there 's one big point to Promises , it 's that nothing can change while physical and psychological barriers keep the sides from speaking even one word to each other .
66265 | 0.55556 | If this movie leaves you cool , it also leaves you intriguingly contemplative .
66267 | 0.70833 | If villainous vampires are your cup of blood , Blade 2 is definitely a cut above the rest .
66268 | 0.65278 | If you 're burnt out on It 's a Wonderful Life marathons and bored with A Christmas Carol , it might just be the movie you 're looking for .
66271 | 0.66667 | If you 're content with a clever pseudo-bio that manages to have a good time as it doles out pieces of the famous director 's life , Eisenstein delivers .
66275 | 0.61111 | If you 're looking for a smart , nuanced look at de Sade and what might have happened at Picpus , Sade is your film .
66281 | 0.44444 | If you 're not totally weirded - out by the notion of cinema as community-therapy spectacle , Quitting hits home with disorienting force .
66286 | 0.80556 | If you can get past the taboo subject matter , it will be well worth your time .
66288 | 0.66667 | If you can swallow its absurdities and crudities Lagaan really is enormously good fun .
66290 | 0.5 | If you can tolerate the redneck-versus-blueblood cliches that the film trades in , Sweet Home Alabama is diverting in the manner of Jeff Foxworthy 's stand-up act .
66296 | 0.93056 | If you ever wanted to be an astronaut , this is the ultimate movie experience - it 's informative and breathtakingly spectacular .
66298 | 0.94444 | If you ever wondered what it would be like to be smack in the middle of a war zone armed with nothing but a camera , this Oscar-nominated documentary takes you there .
66299 | 0.77778 | If you grew up on Scooby -- you 'll love this movie .
66301 | 0.61111 | If you have n't seen the film lately , you may be surprised at the variety of tones in Spielberg 's work .
66308 | 0.45833 | If you ignore the cliches and concentrate on City by the Sea 's interpersonal drama , it ai n't half-bad .
66310 | 0.79167 | If you like blood , guts and crazy beasts stalking men with guns though ... you will likely enjoy this monster .
66312 | 0.72222 | If you like peace , you 'll like Promises .
66314 | 0.72222 | If you love him , you 'll like it .
66316 | 0.86111 | If you love the music , and I do , its hard to imagine having more fun watching a documentary ...
66318 | 0.43056 | If you want to see a train wreck that you ca n't look away from , then look no further , because here it is .
66320 | 0.51389 | Igby Goes Down is one of those movies .
66324 | 0.61111 | Imamura has said that Warm Water Under a Red Bridge is a poem to the enduring strengths of women .
66332 | 0.79167 | Implicitly acknowledges and celebrates the glorious chicanery and self-delusion of this most American of businesses , and for that reason it may be the most oddly honest Hollywood document of all .
66335 | 0.80556 | Impossible as it may sound , this film 's heart is even more embracing than Monty , if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition .
66337 | 0.875 | Impresses as a skillfully assembled , highly polished and professional adaptation ... just about as chilling and unsettling as ` Manhunter ' was .
66339 | 0.66667 | In Auteil 's less dramatic but equally incisive performance , he 's a charismatic charmer likely to seduce and conquer .
66343 | 0.81944 | In XXX , Diesel is that rare creature -- an action hero with table manners , and one who proves that elegance is more than tattoo deep .
66345 | 0.69444 | In a movie full of surprises , the biggest is that Secret Ballot is a comedy , both gentle and biting .
66347 | 0.81944 | In a summer of clones , Harvard Man is something rare and riveting : a wild ride that relies on more than special effects .
66349 | 0.88889 | In a summer overrun with movies dominated by CGI aliens and super heroes , it revigorates the mind to see a feature that concentrates on people , a project in which the script and characters hold sway .
66352 | 0.94444 | In addition to gluing you to the edge of your seat , Changing Lanes is also a film of freshness , imagination and insight .
66363 | 0.79167 | In its treatment of the dehumanizing and ego-destroying process of unemployment , Time Out offers an exploration that is more accurate than anything I have seen in an American film .
66365 | 0.66667 | In its understanding , often funny way , it tells a story whose restatement is validated by the changing composition of the nation .
66367 | 0.56944 | In many ways , reminiscent of 1992 's Unforgiven which also utilized the scintillating force of its actors to draw out the menace of its sparse dialogue .
66371 | 0.75 | In painting an unabashedly romantic picture of a nation whose songs spring directly from the lives of the people , the movie exalts the Marxian dream of honest working folk , with little to show for their labor , living harmoniously , joined in song .
66373 | 0.70833 | In questioning the election process , Payami graphically illustrates the problems of fledgling democracies , but also the strength and sense of freedom the Iranian people already possess , with or without access to the ballot box .
66378 | 0.65278 | In the affable Maid in Manhattan , Jennifer Lopez 's most aggressive and most sincere attempt to take movies by storm , the diva shrewdly surrounds herself with a company of strictly A-list players .
66380 | 0.40278 | In the long , dishonorable history of quickie teen-pop exploitation , Like Mike stands out for its only partly synthetic decency .
66382 | 0.80556 | In the new release of Cinema Paradiso , the tale has turned from sweet to bittersweet , and when the tears come during that final , beautiful scene , they finally feel absolutely earned .
66395 | 0.72222 | Inherently caustic and oddly whimsical , the film chimes in on the grieving process and strangely draws the audience into the unexplainable pain and eccentricities that are attached to the concept of loss .
66397 | 0.95833 | Insanely hilarious !
66405 | 0.94444 | Insomnia is one of the year 's best films and Pacino gives one of his most daring , and complicated , performances .
66406 | 0.68056 | Instead , she sees it as a chance to revitalize what is and always has been remarkable about clung-to traditions .
66408 | 0.69444 | Instead of hitting the audience over the head with a moral , Schrader relies on subtle ironies and visual devices to convey point of view .
66412 | 0.77778 | Intelligent , caustic take on a great writer and dubious human being .
66415 | 0.73611 | Interesting both as a historical study and as a tragic love story .
66424 | 0.79167 | Inventive , fun , intoxicatingly sexy , violent , self-indulgent and maddening .
66429 | 0.91667 | Invigorating , surreal , and resonant with a rainbow of emotion .
66438 | 0.83333 | Irwin is so earnest that it 's hard to resist his pleas to spare wildlife and respect their environs .
66441 | 0.44444 | Is Red Dragon worthy of a place alongside the other Hannibal movies ?
66451 | 0.875 | Isabelle Huppert excels as the enigmatic Mika and Anna Mouglalis is a stunning new young talent in one of Chabrol 's most intense psychological mysteries .
66456 | 0.68056 | It 'll keep you wide awake and ... very tense .
66460 | 0.48611 | It 's Jagger 's bone-dry , mournfully brittle delivery that gives the film its bittersweet bite .
66461 | 0.84722 | It 's Quaid who anchors the film with his effortless performance and that trademark grin of his -- so perfect for a ballplayer .
66467 | 0.90278 | It 's a beautiful film , full of elaborate and twisted characters - and it 's also pretty funny .
66472 | 0.88889 | It 's a compelling and horrifying story , and The Laramie Project is worthwhile for reminding us that this sort of thing does , in fact , still happen in America .
66474 | 0.91667 | It 's a fairy tale that comes from a renowned Indian film culture that allows Americans to finally revel in its splendor .
66475 | 0.77778 | It 's a familiar story , but one that is presented with great sympathy and intelligence .
66476 | 0.83333 | It 's a feel-good movie about which you can actually feel good .
66477 | 0.77778 | It 's a film that 's destined to win a wide summer audience through word-of-mouth reviews and , not far down the line , to find a place among the studio 's animated classics .
66478 | 0.83333 | It 's a fine , focused piece of work that reopens an interesting controversy and never succumbs to sensationalism .
66479 | 0.77778 | It 's a fine , old-fashioned-movie movie , which is to say it 's unburdened by pretensions to great artistic significance .
66482 | 0.98611 | It 's a head-turner -- thoughtfully written , beautifully read and , finally , deeply humanizing .
66483 | 0.81944 | It 's a hoot watching The Rock chomp on jumbo ants , pull an arrow out of his back , and leap unscathed through raging fire !
66484 | 0.81944 | It 's a lovely , eerie film that casts an odd , rapt spell .
66485 | 0.80556 | It 's a lovely , sad dance highlighted by Kwan 's unique directing style .
66487 | 0.73611 | It 's a movie that accomplishes so much that one viewing ca n't possibly be enough .
66488 | 0.84722 | It 's a perfect show of respect to just one of those underrated professionals who deserve but rarely receive it .
66489 | 0.68056 | It 's a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places , but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety .
66490 | 0.86111 | It 's a powerful though flawed movie , guaranteed to put a lump in your throat while reaffirming Washington as possibly the best actor working in movies today .
66491 | 0.70833 | It 's a ripper of a yarn and I for one enjoyed the thrill of the chill .
66497 | 0.63889 | It 's a setup so easy it borders on facile , but keeping the film from cheap-shot mediocrity is its crack cast .
66498 | 0.29167 | It 's a shame the marvelous first 101 minutes have to be combined with the misconceived final 5 .
66503 | 0.79167 | It 's a smart , funny look at an arcane area of popular culture , and if it is n't entirely persuasive , it does give exposure to some talented performers .
66505 | 0.86111 | It 's a smartly directed , grown-up film of ideas .
66506 | 0.66667 | It 's a solid movie about people whose lives are anything but .
66507 | 0.77778 | It 's a square , sentimental drama that satisfies , as comfort food often can .
66508 | 0.25 | It 's a strange film , one that was hard for me to warm up to .
66509 | 0.73611 | It 's a talking head documentary , but a great one .
66510 | 0.51389 | It 's a tour de force , written and directed so quietly that it 's implosion rather than explosion you fear .
66511 | 0.79167 | It 's a treat watching Shaw , a British stage icon , melting under the heat of Phocion 's attentions .
66512 | 0.68056 | It 's a visual delight and a decent popcorn adventure , as long as you do n't try to look too deep into the story
66513 | 0.93056 | It 's a wise and powerful tale of race and culture forcefully told , with superb performances throughout .
66514 | 0.90278 | It 's a wonderful , sobering , heart-felt drama .
66515 | 0.27778 | It 's about as convincing as any other Arnie musclefest , but has a little too much resonance with real world events and ultimately comes off as insultingly simplistic .
66516 | 0.875 | It 's about individual moments of mood , and an aimlessness that 's actually sort of amazing .
66517 | 0.77778 | It 's affecting , amusing , sad and reflective .
66518 | 0.52778 | It 's all a rather shapeless good time ...
66519 | 0.83333 | It 's all about Anakin ... and the lustrous polished visuals rich in color and creativity and , of course , special effect .
66520 | 0.54167 | It 's all entertaining enough , but do n't look for any hefty anti-establishment message in what is essentially a whip-crack of a buddy movie that ends with a whimper .
66521 | 0.80556 | It 's all stitched together with energy , intelligence and verve , enhanced by a surplus of vintage archive footage .
66522 | 0.72222 | It 's always fascinating to watch Marker the essayist at work .
66524 | 0.63889 | It 's an ambitious film , and as with all ambitious films , it has some problems .
66528 | 0.77778 | It 's an experience in understanding a unique culture that is presented with universal appeal .
66534 | 0.5 | It 's an often-cute film but either needs more substance to fill the time or some judicious editing .
66535 | 0.875 | It 's anchored by splendid performances from an honored screen veteran and a sparkling newcomer who instantly transform themselves into a believable mother\/daughter pair .
66541 | 0.81944 | It 's as raw and action-packed an experience as a ringside seat at a tough-man contest .
66542 | 0.625 | It 's both degrading and strangely liberating to see people working so hard at leading lives of sexy intrigue , only to be revealed by the dispassionate Gantz brothers as ordinary , pasty lumpen .
66544 | 0.79167 | It 's bright , pristine style and bold colors make it as much fun as reading an oversized picture book before bedtime .
66545 | 0.77778 | It 's consistently funny , in an irresistible junior-high way , and consistently free of any gag that would force you to give it a millisecond of thought .
66549 | 0.84722 | It 's crafty , energetic and smart -- the kid is sort of like a fourteen-year old Ferris Bueller .
66550 | 0.70833 | It 's definitely an improvement on the first Blade , since it does n't take itself so deadly seriously .
66551 | 0.70833 | It 's fairly solid -- not to mention well edited so that it certainly does n't feel like a film that strays past the two and a half mark .
66553 | 0.61111 | It 's full of cheesy dialogue , but great trashy fun that finally returns De Palma to his pulpy thrillers of the early '80s .
66554 | 0.72222 | It 's fun , splashy and entertainingly nasty .
66555 | 0.77778 | It 's fun , wispy , wise and surprisingly inoffensive for a film about a teen in love with his stepmom .
66556 | 0.88889 | It 's funny , touching , dramatically forceful , and beautifully shot .
66557 | 0.77778 | It 's funny and human and really pretty damned wonderful , all at once .
66558 | 0.75 | It 's good to see Michael Caine whipping out the dirty words and punching people in the stomach again .
66565 | 0.47222 | It 's got some pretentious eye-rolling moments and it did n't entirely grab me , but there 's stuff here to like .
66567 | 0.81944 | It 's hard to imagine anyone managing to steal a movie not only from charismatic rising star Jake Gyllenhaal but also from accomplished Oscar winners Susan Sarandon , Dustin Hoffman and Holly Hunter , yet newcomer Ellen Pompeo pulls off the feat with aplomb .
66568 | 0.91667 | It 's immensely ambitious , different than anything that 's been done before and amazingly successful in terms of what it 's trying to do .
66577 | 0.73611 | It 's light on the chills and heavy on the atmospheric weirdness , and there are moments of jaw-droppingly odd behavior -- yet I found it weirdly appealing .
66581 | 0.73611 | It 's mildly entertaining , especially if you find comfort in familiarity .
66585 | 0.63889 | It 's mostly a pleasure to watch .
66589 | 0.83333 | It 's never dull and always looks good .
66590 | 0.80556 | It 's no accident that The Accidental Spy is a solid action pic that returns the martial arts master to top form .
66594 | 0.83333 | It 's no lie -- Big Fat Liar is a real charmer .
66595 | 0.83333 | It 's no surprise that as a director Washington demands and receives excellent performances , from himself and from newcomer Derek Luke .
66600 | 0.47222 | It 's not a classic spy-action or buddy movie , but it 's entertaining enough and worth a look .
66606 | 0.70833 | It 's not going to be everyone 's bag of popcorn , but it definitely gives you something to chew on .
66622 | 0.68056 | It 's not like having a real film of Nijinsky , but at least it 's better than that eponymous 1980 biopic that used soap in the places where the mysteries lingered .
66626 | 0.48611 | It 's not particularly subtle ... However , it still manages to build to a terrifying , if obvious , conclusion .
66627 | 0.36111 | It 's not the least of Afghan tragedies that this noble warlord would be consigned to the dustbin of history .
66632 | 0.56944 | It 's packed to bursting with incident , and with scores of characters , some fictional , some from history .
66646 | 0.66667 | It 's pretty linear and only makeup-deep , but Bogdanovich ties it together with efficiency and an affection for the period .
66649 | 0.29167 | It 's quite diverting nonsense .
66650 | 0.69444 | It 's rare for any movie to be as subtle and touching as The Son 's Room .
66651 | 0.73611 | It 's refreshing to see a romance this smart .
66652 | 0.76389 | It 's secondary to American Psycho but still has claws enough to get inside you and stay there for a couple of hours .
66653 | 0.97222 | It 's something of the ultimate Scorsese film , with all the stomach-turning violence , colorful New York gang lore and other hallmarks of his personal cinema painted on their largest-ever historical canvas .

66675 | 0.77778 | It 's the cute frissons of discovery and humor between Chaplin and Kidman that keep this nicely wound clock not just ticking , but humming .
66683 | 0.72222 | It 's the type of film about growing up that we do n't see often enough these days : realistic , urgent , and not sugarcoated in the least .
66684 | 0.68056 | It 's truly awful and heartbreaking subject matter , but one whose lessons are well worth revisiting as many times as possible .
66690 | 0.73611 | It 's very Beavis and Butthead , yet always seems to elicit a chuckle .
66691 | 0.31944 | It 's virtually impossible to like any of these despicable characters .
66692 | 0.77778 | It 's weird , wonderful , and not necessarily for kids .
66697 | 0.66667 | It ai n't art , by a long shot , but unlike last year 's lame Musketeer , this Dumas adaptation entertains .
66698 | 0.73611 | It all plays out ... like a high-end John Hughes comedy , a kind of Elder Bueller 's Time Out .
66699 | 0.79167 | It asks nothing of the audience other than to sit back and enjoy a couple of great actors hamming it up .
66700 | 0.63889 | It cooks Conduct in a low , smoky and inviting sizzle .
66701 | 0.41667 | It depends on how well flatulence gags fit into your holiday concept .

66709 | 0.72222 | It establishes its ominous mood and tension swiftly , and if the suspense never rises to a higher level , it is nevertheless maintained throughout .
66710 | 0.70833 | It excels because , unlike so many other Hollywood movies of its ilk , it offers hope .
66711 | 0.68056 | It finds its moviegoing pleasures in the tiny events that could make a person who has lived her life half-asleep suddenly wake up and take notice .
66713 | 0.72222 | It gives devastating testimony to both people 's capacity for evil and their heroic capacity for good .
66714 | 0.68056 | It grabs you in the dark and shakes you vigorously for its duration .
66715 | 0.72222 | It has a caffeinated , sloppy brilliance , sparkling with ideas you wish had been developed with more care , but animated by an energy that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined grade-grubbers to shame .
66716 | 0.72222 | It has a way of seeping into your consciousness , with lingering questions about what the film is really getting at .
66719 | 0.80556 | It has that rare quality of being able to creep the living hell out of you ...
66726 | 0.70833 | It is OK for a movie to be something of a sitcom apparatus , if the lines work , the humor has point and the actors are humanly engaged .

66728 | 0.52778 | It is a challenging film , if not always a narratively cohesive one .
66729 | 0.90278 | It is a happy , heady jumble of thought and storytelling , an insane comic undertaking that ultimately coheres into a sane and breathtakingly creative film .
66730 | 0.72222 | It is a likable story , told with competence .
66732 | 0.66667 | It is a strength of a documentary to disregard available bias , especially as temptingly easy as it would have been with this premise .
66733 | 0.52778 | It is an indelible epic American story about two families , one black and one white , facing change in both their inner and outer lives .
66734 | 0.70833 | It is an unstinting look at a collaboration between damaged people that may or may not qual
66735 | 0.63889 | It is as uncompromising as it is nonjudgmental , and makes clear that a prostitute can be as lonely and needy as any of the clients .
66736 | 0.625 | It is philosophy , illustrated through everyday events .
66737 | 0.77778 | It is quite a vision .
66738 | 0.81944 | It is refreshingly undogmatic about its characters .
66739 | 0.55556 | It is there to give them a good time .
66740 | 0.5 | It is up to you to decide if you need to see it .

66743 | 0.66667 | It manages to squeeze by on Angelina Jolie 's surprising flair for self-deprecating comedy .
66744 | 0.95833 | It may also be the best sex comedy about environmental pollution ever made .
66749 | 0.45833 | It may be about drug dealers , kidnapping , and unsavory folks , but the tone and pacing are shockingly intimate .
66754 | 0.73611 | It may not be a great piece of filmmaking , but its power comes from its soul 's - eye view of how well-meaning patronizing masked a social injustice , at least as represented by this case .
66759 | 0.52778 | It may sound like a mere disease-of - the-week TV movie , but A Song For Martin is made infinitely more wrenching by the performances of real-life spouses Seldahl and Wollter .
66764 | 0.73611 | It might be ` easier ' to watch on video at home , but that should n't stop die-hard French film connoisseurs from going out and enjoying the big-screen experience .
66769 | 0.66667 | It must be the end of the world : the best film so far this year is a franchise sequel starring Wesley Snipes .

66771 | 0.66667 | It reaffirms life as it looks in the face of death .
66773 | 0.41667 | It remains to be seen whether Statham can move beyond the crime-land action genre , but then again , who says he has to ?
66774 | 0.43056 | It seems Grant does n't need the floppy hair and the self-deprecating stammers after all .
66775 | 0.84722 | It sends you away a believer again and quite cheered at just that .
66776 | 0.65278 | It shows us a slice of life that 's very different from our own and yet instantly recognizable .
66777 | 0.94444 | It tends to remind one of a really solid Woody Allen film , with its excellent use of New York locales and sharp writing

66779 | 0.83333 | It trusts the story it sets out to tell .
66780 | 0.80556 | It turns out to be smarter and more diabolical than you could have guessed at the beginning .
66781 | 0.56944 | It understands , in a way that speaks forcefully enough about the mechanisms of poverty to transcend the rather simplistic filmmaking .
66782 | 0.75 | It was only a matter of time before some savvy producer saw the potential success inherent in the mixture of Bullock Bubble and Hugh Goo .
66783 | 0.63889 | It will make you think twice about what might be going on inside each trailer park you drive past -- even if it chiefly inspires you to drive a little faster .
66788 | 0.63889 | It wo n't hold up over the long haul , but in the moment , Finch 's tale provides the forgettable pleasures of a Saturday matinee .
66793 | 0.73611 | It works well enough , since the thrills pop up frequently , and the dispatching of the cast is as often imaginative as it is gory .
66794 | 0.13889 | It would take a complete moron to foul up a screen adaptation of Oscar Wilde 's classic satire .
66795 | 0.84722 | It zips along with B-movie verve while adding the rich details and go-for-broke acting that heralds something special .
66798 | 0.70833 | Its adult themes of familial separation and societal betrayal are head and shoulders above much of the director 's previous popcorn work .
66801 | 0.66667 | Its almost too-spectacular coastal setting distracts slightly from an eccentric and good-naturedly aimless story .
66804 | 0.72222 | Its cast full of caffeinated comedy performances more than make up for its logical loopholes , which fly by so fast there 's no time to think about them anyway .
66806 | 0.79167 | Its director 's most substantial feature for some time .
66808 | 0.83333 | Its engaging simplicity is driven by appealing leads .
66811 | 0.80556 | Its gentle , touching story creeps into your heart .

66842 | 0.77778 | Jackie Chan movies are a guilty pleasure - he 's easy to like and always leaves us laughing .
66850 | 0.61111 | Jackson is always watchable .
66855 | 0.55556 | Jackson tries to keep the plates spinning as best he can , but all the bouncing back and forth ca n't help but become a bit tedious -- even with the breathtaking landscapes and villainous varmints there to distract you from the ricocheting .

66905 | 0.73611 | Jeong-Hyang Lee 's film is deceptively simple , deeply satisfying .
66962 | 0.88889 | Judith and Zaza 's extended bedroom sequence ... is so intimate and sensual and funny and psychologically self-revealing that it makes most of what passes for sex in the movies look like cheap hysterics .
66969 | 0.55556 | Just how these families interact may surprise you .
66971 | 0.70833 | Just offbeat enough to keep you interested without coming close to bowling you over .
66974 | 0.73611 | K 19 stays afloat as decent drama\/action flick
66975 | 0.76389 | K-19 : The Widowmaker is a great yarn .
66980 | 0.73611 | K-19 will not go down in the annals of cinema as one of the great submarine stories , but it is an engaging and exciting narrative of Man confronting the Demons of his own fear and paranoia .
66993 | 0.65278 | Katz 's documentary does n't have much panache , but with material this rich it does n't need it .
66998 | 0.56944 | Kaufman and Jonze take huge risks to ponder the whole notion of passion -- our desire as human beings for passion in our lives and the emptiness one feels when it is missing .
67005 | 0.72222 | Khouri manages , with terrific flair , to keep the extremes of screwball farce and blood-curdling family intensity on one continuum .

67070 | 0.66667 | Koury frighteningly and honestly exposes one teenager 's uncomfortable class resentment and , in turn , his self-inflicted retaliation .
67080 | 0.91667 | Kudos to the most enchanting film of the year .
67092 | 0.66667 | Kwan is a master of shadow , quietude , and room noise , and Lan Yu is a disarmingly lived-in movie .
67097 | 0.86111 | LaBute 's careful handling makes the material seem genuine rather than pandering .
67101 | 0.125 | Lacks the inspiration of the original and has a bloated plot that stretches the running time about 10 minutes past a child 's interest and an adult 's patience .
67115 | 0.66667 | Land , people and narrative flow together in a stark portrait of motherhood deferred and desire explored .
67136 | 0.625 | Lasker 's canny , meditative script distances sex and love , as Byron and Luther ... realize they ca n't get no satisfaction without the latter .

67159 | 0.81944 | Leaping from one arresting image to another , Songs from the Second Floor has all the enjoyable randomness of a very lively dream and so manages to be compelling , amusing and unsettling at the same time .

67170 | 0.625 | Lee 's achievement extends to his supple understanding of the role that Brown played in American culture as an athlete , a movie star , and an image of black indomitability .
67175 | 0.76389 | Left me with the visceral sensation of longing , lasting traces of Charlotte 's web of desire and desperation .
67182 | 0.59722 | Leigh 's daring here is that without once denying the hardscrabble lives of people on the economic fringes of Margaret Thatcher 's ruinous legacy , he insists on the importance of those moments when people can connect and express their love for each other .
67184 | 0.75 | Leigh makes these lives count .
67188 | 0.75 | Leigh succeeds in delivering a dramatic slap in the face that 's simultaneously painful and refreshing .

67227 | 0.72222 | Like Kubrick , Soderbergh is n't afraid to try any genre and to do it his own way .
67237 | 0.16667 | Like Rudy Yellow Lodge , Eyre needs to take a good sweat to clarify his cinematic vision before his next creation and remember the lessons of the trickster spider .
67239 | 0.83333 | Like Shrek , Spirit 's visual imagination reminds you of why animation is such a perfect medium for children , because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world .
67241 | 0.83333 | Like The Full Monty , this is sure to raise audience 's spirits and leave them singing long after the credits roll .
67243 | 0.80556 | Like Vardalos and Corbett , who play their roles with vibrant charm , the film , directed by Joel Zwick , is heartfelt and hilarious in ways you ca n't fake .
67245 | 0.77778 | Like a Tarantino movie with heart , Alias Betty is richly detailed , deftly executed and utterly absorbing .
67254 | 0.88889 | Like a skillful fisher , the director uses the last act to reel in the audience since its poignancy hooks us completely .

67264 | 0.70833 | Like its New England characters , most of whom wander about in thick clouds of denial , the movie eventually gets around to its real emotional business , striking deep chords of sadness .
67266 | 0.66667 | Like its bizarre heroine , it irrigates our souls .
67272 | 0.51389 | Like its predecessor , it 's no classic , but it provides a reasonably attractive holiday contraption , one that families looking for a clean , kid-friendly outing should investigate .
67278 | 0.84722 | Like the best of Godard 's movies ... it is visually ravishing , penetrating , impenetrable .
67280 | 0.73611 | Like the chilled breath of oral storytelling frozen onto film .
67302 | 0.44444 | Lohman adapts to the changes required of her , but the actress and director Peter Kosminsky never get the audience to break through the wall her character erects
67348 | 0.51389 | Maelstrom is a deliberately unsteady mixture of stylistic elements .
67360 | 0.59722 | Maid in Manhattan might not look so appealing on third or fourth viewing down the road ... But as a high concept vehicle for two bright stars of the moment who can rise to fans ' lofty expectations , the movie passes inspection .

68692 | 0.69444 | Seeks to transcend its genre with a curiously stylized , quasi-Shakespearean portrait of pure misogynist evil .
68697 | 0.80556 | Seems based on ugly ideas instead of ugly behavior , as Happiness was ... Hence , Storytelling is far more appealing .

69560 | 0.81944 | The film is enriched by an imaginatively mixed cast of antic spirits , headed by Christopher Plummer as the subtlest and most complexly evil Uncle Ralph I 've ever seen in the many film and stage adaptations of the work .

69580 | 0.73611 | The film proves unrelentingly grim -- and equally engrossing .

69620 | 0.80556 | The fun of the movie is the chance it affords to watch Jackson , who also served as executive producer , take his smooth , shrewd , powerful act abroad .
69622 | 0.65278 | The gags are often a stitch .
69625 | 0.86111 | The genius of the work speaks volumes , offering up a hallucinatory dreamscape that frustrates and captivates .
69628 | 0.66667 | The graphic carnage and re-creation of war-torn Croatia is uncomfortably timely , relevant , and sickeningly real .

69693 | 0.59722 | The message is that even the most unlikely can link together to conquer all kinds of obstacles , whether they be of nature , of man or of one another .

69730 | 0.76389 | The movie does its best to work us over , with second helpings of love , romance , tragedy , false dawns , real dawns , comic relief , two separate crises during marriage ceremonies , and the lush scenery of the Cotswolds .

69736 | 0.51389 | The movie has no respect for laws , political correctness or common decency , but it displays something more important : respect for its flawed , crazy people .

69758 | 0.77778 | The movie itself is far from disappointing , offering an original take on courtroom movies , a few nifty twists that are so crucial to the genre and another first-rate performance by top-billed star Bruce Willis .
69759 | 0.59722 | The movie plays up the cartoon 's more obvious strength of snazziness while neglecting its less conspicuous writing strength .

69766 | 0.55556 | The movie ultimately relies a bit too heavily on grandstanding , emotional , Rocky-like moments ... but it 's such a warm and charming package that you 'll feel too happy to argue much .
69772 | 0.79167 | The new Insomnia is a surprisingly faithful remake of its chilly predecessor , and when it does elect to head off in its own direction , it employs changes that fit it well rather than ones that were imposed for the sake of commercial sensibilities .
69774 | 0.69444 | The obnoxious title character provides the drama that gives added clout to this doc .
69777 | 0.75 | The observations of this social\/economic\/urban environment are canny and spiced with irony .
69783 | 0.72222 | The off-center humor is a constant , and the ensemble gives it a buoyant delivery .

69843 | 0.68056 | The power of Shanghai Ghetto , a documentary by Dana Janklowicz-Mann and Amir Mann , rests in the voices of men and women , now in their 70s , who lived there in the 1940s .

69863 | 0.72222 | The result is somewhat satisfying -- it still comes from Spielberg , who has never made anything that was n't at least watchable .
69867 | 0.79167 | The result puts a human face on Derrida , and makes one of the great minds of our times interesting and accessible to people who normally could n't care less .
69869 | 0.54167 | The results , if not memorable , are at least interesting .
69873 | 0.72222 | The rich performances by Friel -- and especially Williams , an American actress who becomes fully English -- round out the square edges .
69876 | 0.88889 | The riveting performances by the incredibly flexible cast make Love a joy to behold .

69913 | 0.69444 | The spaniel-eyed Jean Reno infuses Hubert with a mixture of deadpan cool , wry humor and just the measure of tenderness required to give this comic slugfest some heart .
69923 | 0.76389 | The stars may be college kids , but the subject matter is as adult as you can get : the temptations of the flesh are unleashed by a slightly crazed , overtly determined young woman and a one-night swim turns into an ocean of trouble .
69934 | 0.83333 | The story , once it gets rolling , is nothing short of a great one .
69935 | 0.36111 | The story has some nice twists but the ending and some of the back-story is a little tired .
69943 | 0.73611 | The story is a rather simplistic one : grief drives her , love drives him , and a second chance to find love in the most unlikely place - it struck a chord in me .
69949 | 0.61111 | The story line may be 127 years old , but El Crimen del Padre Amaro ... could n't be more timely in its despairing vision of corruption within the Catholic establishment .
69950 | 0.83333 | The story ultimately takes hold and grips hard .
69956 | 1 | The storylines are woven together skilfully , the magnificent swooping aerial shots are breathtaking , and the overall experience is awesome .
69962 | 0.66667 | The storytelling may be ordinary , but the cast is one of those all-star reunions that fans of Gosford Park have come to assume is just another day of Brit cinema .
69968 | 0.48611 | The stripped-down dramatic constructs , austere imagery and abstract characters are equal parts poetry and politics , obvious at times but evocative and heartfelt .
69970 | 0.55556 | The strong subject matter continues to shock throughout the film .
69977 | 0.70833 | The structure is simple , but in its own way , Rabbit-Proof Fence is a quest story as grand as The Lord of the Rings .
69983 | 0.79167 | The subtitled costume drama is set in a remote African empire before cell phones , guns , and the internal combustion engine , but the politics that thump through it are as timely as tomorrow .
69986 | 0.66667 | The success of Undercover Brother is found in its ability to spoof both black and white stereotypes equally .
69991 | 0.75 | The sword fighting is well done and Auteuil is a goofy pleasure .
69993 | 0.70833 | The tasteful little revision works wonders , enhancing the cultural and economic subtext , bringing richer meaning to the story 's morals .
69999 | 0.58333 | The tonal shifts are jolting , and though Wen 's messages are profound and thoughtfully delivered , more thorough transitions would have made the film more cohesive .
70000 | 0.58333 | The tone errs on the shrill side , tempered by a soft southern gentility that speaks of beauty , grace and a closet full of skeletons .
70003 | 0.79167 | The trick when watching Godard is to catch the pitch of his poetics , savor the pleasure of his sounds and images , and ponder the historical , philosophical , and ethical issues that intersect with them .
70010 | 0.83333 | The two leads , nearly perfect in their roles , bring a heart and reality that buoy the film , and at times , elevate it to a superior crime movie .
70013 | 0.98611 | The universal theme of becoming a better person through love has never been filmed more irresistibly than in ` Baran . '
70019 | 0.86111 | The urban landscapes are detailed down to the signs on the kiosks , and the color palette , with lots of somber blues and pinks , is dreamy and evocative .
70023 | 0.76389 | The usual movie rah-rah , pleasantly and predictably delivered in low-key style by director Michael Apted and writer Tom Stoppard .
70025 | 0.76389 | The viewer takes great pleasure in watching the resourceful Molly stay a step ahead of her pursuers .
70026 | 0.80556 | The way the roundelay of partners functions , and the interplay within partnerships and among partnerships and the general air of Gator-bashing are consistently delightful .
70029 | 0.59722 | The whole mildly pleasant outing -- the R rating is for brief nudity and a grisly corpse -- remains aloft not on its own self-referential hot air , but on the inspired performance of Tim Allen .
70032 | 0.86111 | The wonder of Mostly Martha is the performance of Gedeck , who makes Martha enormously endearing .
70035 | 0.72222 | The word that comes to mind , while watching Eric Rohmer 's tribute to a courageous Scottish lady , is painterly .
70037 | 0.66667 | The work of an artist tormented by his heritage , using his storytelling ability to honor the many faceless victims .
70042 | 0.875 | The writing is clever and the cast is appealing .
70049 | 0.83333 | The year 's greatest adventure , and Jackson 's limited but enthusiastic adaptation has made literature literal without killing its soul -- a feat any thinking person is bound to appreciate .
70055 | 0.81944 | The year 2002 has conjured up more coming-of-age stories than seem possible , but Take Care of My Cat emerges as the very best of them .
70066 | 0.25 | There 's ... an underlying Old World sexism to Monday Morning that undercuts its charm .
70067 | 0.72222 | There 's a lot to recommend Read My Lips .
70068 | 0.73611 | There 's a spontaneity to The Chateau , a sense of light-heartedness , that makes it attractive throughout .
70069 | 0.63889 | There 's just something about watching a squad of psychopathic underdogs whale the tar out of unsuspecting lawmen that reaches across time and distance .
70070 | 0.5 | There 's no clear picture of who killed Bob Crane .
70079 | 0.79167 | There 's no conversion effort , much of the writing is genuinely witty and both stars are appealing enough to probably have a good shot at a Hollywood career , if they want one .
70084 | 0.84722 | There 's none of the happily-ever - after spangle of Monsoon Wedding in Late Marriage -- and that 's part of what makes Dover Kosashvili 's outstanding feature debut so potent .
70089 | 0.41667 | There 's not much to Fatale , outside of its stylish surprises ... but that 's OK .
70094 | 0.81944 | There 's nothing like love to give a movie a B-12 shot , and CQ shimmers with it .
70095 | 0.79167 | There 's nothing more satisfying during a summer of event movies than a spy thriller like The Bourne Identity that 's packed with just as much intelligence as action .
70097 | 0.86111 | There 's so much to look at in Metropolis you hate to tear your eyes away from the images long enough to read the subtitles .
70098 | 0.55556 | There 's something about a marching band that gets me where I live .
70103 | 0.52778 | There 's very little sense to what 's going on here , but the makers serve up the cliches with considerable dash .
70105 | 0.56944 | There are far worse messages to teach a young audience , which will probably be perfectly happy with the sloppy slapstick comedy .
70109 | 0.76389 | There are flaws , but also stretches of impact and moments of awe ; we 're wrapped up in the characters , how they make their choices , and why .
70115 | 0.69444 | There are laughs aplenty , and , as a bonus , viewers do n't have to worry about being subjected to farts , urine , feces , semen , or any of the other foul substances that have overrun modern-day comedies .
70116 | 0.77778 | There are moments of hilarity to be had .
70127 | 0.73611 | There are some movies that hit you from the first scene and you know it 's going to be a trip .
70133 | 0.58333 | There are times when you wish that the movie had worked a little harder to conceal its contrivances , but Brown Sugar turns out to be a sweet and enjoyable fantasy .
70136 | 0.75 | There is a freedom to watching stunts that are this crude , this fast-paced and this insane .
70137 | 0.79167 | There is a strong directorial stamp on every frame of this stylish film that is able to visualize schizophrenia but is still confident enough to step back and look at the sick character with a sane eye .
70138 | 0.80556 | There is a welcome lack of pretension about the film , which very simply sets out to entertain and ends up delivering in good measure .
70139 | 0.84722 | There is greatness here .
70140 | 0.65278 | There is little question that this is a serious work by an important director who has something new to say about how , in the flip-flop of courtship , we often reel in when we should be playing out .
70142 | 0.77778 | There is no denying the power of Polanski 's film ...
70143 | 0.22222 | There is no solace here , no entertainment value , merely a fierce lesson in where filmmaking can take us .
70148 | 0.81944 | There is no substitute for on-screen chemistry , and when Friel pulls the strings that make Williams sink into melancholia , the reaction in Williams is as visceral as a gut punch .
70154 | 0.76389 | These characters are so well established that the gang feels comfortable with taking insane liberties and doing the goofiest stuff out of left field , and I 'm all for that .
70157 | 0.83333 | These three films form a remarkably cohesive whole , both visually and thematically , through their consistently sensitive and often exciting treatment of an ignored people .
70162 | 0.70833 | They 're just a couple of cops in Copmovieland , these two , but in Narc , they find new routes through a familiar neighborhood .
70168 | 0.88889 | Think of it as Gidget , only with muscles and a lot more smarts , but just as endearing and easy to watch .
70173 | 0.75 | This 90-minute postmodern voyage was more diverting and thought-provoking than I 'd expected it to be .
70175 | 0.58333 | This big screen caper has a good bark , far from being a bow-wow .
70178 | 0.86111 | This charming , thought-provoking New York fest of life and love has its rewards .
70180 | 0.79167 | This charming but slight tale has warmth , wit and interesting characters compassionately portrayed .
70189 | 0.55556 | This engrossing , characteristically complex Tom Clancy thriller is shifty in the manner in which it addresses current terrorism anxieties and sidesteps them at the same time .
70191 | 0.91667 | This enthralling documentary ... is at once playful and haunting , an in-depth portrait of an iconoclastic artist who was fundamentally unknowable even to his closest friends .
70193 | 0.66667 | This fascinating experiment plays as more of a poetic than a strict reality , creating an intriguing species of artifice that gives The Lady and the Duke something of a theatrical air .
70194 | 0.65278 | This film can only point the way -- but thank goodness for this signpost .
70195 | 0.77778 | This film is so different from The Apple and so striking that it can only encourage us to see Samira Makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility , working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success .
70196 | 0.86111 | This film puts Wang at the forefront of China 's Sixth Generation of film makers .
70199 | 0.65278 | This filmed Tosca -- not the first , by the way -- is a pretty good job , if it 's filmed Tosca that you want .
70203 | 0.75 | This in-depth study of important developments of the computer industry should make it required viewing in university computer science departments for years to come .
70204 | 0.63889 | This is Christmas Future for a lot of baby boomers .
70205 | 1 | This is DiCaprio 's best performance in anything ever , and easily the most watchable film of the year .
70210 | 0.70833 | This is a film that manages to find greatness in the hue of its drastic iconography .
70211 | 0.88889 | This is a finely written , superbly acted offbeat thriller .
70212 | 0.58333 | This is a harrowing movie about how parents know where all the buttons are , and how to push them .
70216 | 0.80556 | This is a sincerely crafted picture that deserves to emerge from the traffic jam of holiday movies .
70217 | 0.76389 | This is a smart movie that knows its classical music , knows its Freud and knows its Sade .
70218 | 0.95833 | This is a story that zings all the way through with originality , humour and pathos .

70221 | 0.91667 | This is a very funny , heartwarming film .
70226 | 0.79167 | This is a visually stunning rumination on love , memory , history and the war between art and commerce .
70227 | 0.80556 | This is an exercise in chilling style , and Twohy films the sub , inside and out , with an eye on preserving a sense of mystery .
70228 | 0.80556 | This is an extraordinary film , not least because it is Japanese and yet feels universal .
70229 | 0.86111 | This is an undeniably intriguing film from an adventurous young talent who finds his inspiration on the fringes of the American underground .
70236 | 0.68056 | This is lightweight filmmaking , to be sure , but it 's pleasant enough -- and oozing with attractive men .
70237 | 0.83333 | This is more fascinating -- being real -- than anything seen on Jerry Springer .
70238 | 0.52778 | This is mostly well-constructed fluff , which is all it seems intended to be .
70239 | 0.56944 | This is n't a retooled genre piece , the tale of a guy and his gun , but an amiably idiosyncratic work .
70248 | 0.65278 | This is n't exactly profound cinema , but it 's good-natured and sometimes quite funny .
70253 | 0.51389 | This is not Chabrol 's best , but even his lesser works outshine the best some directors can offer .
70254 | 0.38889 | This is not an easy film .
70258 | 0.84722 | This is one of the outstanding thrillers of recent years .

70261 | 0.91667 | This is pure , exciting moviemaking .
70267 | 0.79167 | This is the kind of subject matter that could so easily have been fumbled by a lesser filmmaker , but Ayres makes the right choices at every turn .
70268 | 0.75 | This is unusual , food-for-thought cinema that 's as entertaining as it is instructive .
70269 | 0.84722 | This may be Burns 's strongest film since The Brothers McMullen .
70274 | 0.51389 | This may be Dover Kosashvili 's feature directing debut , but it looks an awful lot like life -- gritty , awkward and ironic .
70279 | 0.52778 | This movie has a strong message about never giving up on a loved one , but it 's not an easy movie to watch and will probably disturb many who see it .
70284 | 0.79167 | This movie has the usual impossible stunts ... But it has just as many scenes that are lean and tough enough to fit in any modern action movie .
70287 | 0.625 | This new movie version of the Alexandre Dumas classic is the stuff of high romance , brought off with considerable wit .
70290 | 0.38889 | This odd , distant Portuguese import more or less borrows from Bad Lieutenant and Les Vampires , and comes up with a kind of art-house gay porn film .
70299 | 0.81944 | This odd , poetic road movie , spiked by jolts of pop music , pretty much takes place in Morton 's ever-watchful gaze -- and it 's a tribute to the actress , and to her inventive director , that the journey is such a mesmerizing one .
70302 | 0.56944 | This one is strictly a lightweight escapist film .
70310 | 0.77778 | This real-life Hollywood fairy-tale is more engaging than the usual fantasies Hollywood produces .
70313 | 0.77778 | This rush to profits has created a predictably efficient piece of business notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness , for an eagerness to create images you wish you had n't seen , which , in this day and age , is of course the point .
70315 | 0.44444 | This sci-fi techno-sex thriller starts out bizarre and just keeps getting weirder .
70317 | 0.88889 | This sensitive , smart , savvy , compelling coming-of-age drama delves into the passive-aggressive psychology of co-dependence and the struggle for self-esteem .
70321 | 0.72222 | This slight premise ... works because of the ideal casting of the masterful British actor Ian Holm as the aged Napoleon .
70329 | 0.77778 | This story of a determined woman 's courage to find her husband in a war zone offers winning performances and some effecting moments .
70336 | 0.625 | Those prone to indignation need not apply ; those susceptible to blue hilarity , step right up .
70340 | 0.72222 | Those who want to be jolted out of their gourd should drop everything and run to Ichi .
70342 | 0.68056 | Those with a modicum of patience will find in these characters ' foibles a timeless and unique perspective .
70344 | 0.54167 | Though Frodo 's quest remains unfulfilled , a hardy group of determined New Zealanders has proved its creative mettle .
70346 | 0.65278 | Though Jackson does n't always succeed in integrating the characters in the foreground into the extraordinarily rich landscape , it must be said that he is an imaginative filmmaker who can see the forest for the trees .
70348 | 0.70833 | Though Lan Yu lacks a sense of dramatic urgency , the film makes up for it with a pleasing verisimilitude .
70350 | 0.61111 | Though a touch too Arthouse 101 in its poetic symbolism , Heaven proves to be a good match of the sensibilities of two directors .
70352 | 0.30556 | Though an important political documentary , this does not really make the case the Kissinger should be tried as a war criminal .

70360 | 0.66667 | Though intrepid in exploring an attraction that crosses sexual identity , Ozpetek falls short in showing us Antonia 's true emotions ... But at the very least , His Secret Life will leave you thinking .
70362 | 0.77778 | Though it 's equally solipsistic in tone , the movie has enough vitality to justify the notion of creating a screen adaptation of Evans ' saga of Hollywood excess .

70366 | 0.55556 | Though it never rises to its full potential as a film , still offers a great deal of insight into the female condition and the timeless danger of emotions repressed .
70370 | 0.52778 | Though not for everyone , The Guys is a somber trip worth taking .
70372 | 0.69444 | Though the story ... is hackneyed , the characters have a freshness and modesty that transcends their predicament .
70374 | 0.69444 | Though writer\/director Bart Freundlich 's film ultimately becomes a simplistic story about a dysfunctional parent-child relationship , it has some special qualities and the soulful gravity of Crudup 's anchoring performance .
70378 | 0.66667 | Thought-provoking and stylish , if also somewhat hermetic .
70386 | 0.56944 | Throwing it all away for the fleeting joys of love 's brief moment .

70396 | 0.90278 | Time is a beautiful film to watch , an interesting and at times captivating take on loss and loneliness .
70401 | 0.29167 | To honestly address the flaws inherent in how medical aid is made available to American workers , a more balanced or fair portrayal of both sides will be needed .
70409 | 0.73611 | Toes the fine line between cheese and earnestness remarkably well ; everything is delivered with such conviction that it 's hard not to be carried away .
70410 | 0.625 | Together , Miller , Kuras and the actresses make Personal Velocity into an intricate , intimate and intelligent journey .
70411 | 0.75 | Together writer-director Danny Verete 's three tales comprise a powerful and reasonably fulfilling gestalt .

70458 | 0.72222 | Trapped wo n't score points for political correctness , but it may cause parents a few sleepless hours -- a sign of its effectiveness .
70466 | 0.69444 | Tres Greek writer and star Nia Vardalos has crafted here a worldly-wise and very funny script .
70482 | 0.47222 | Triumph of Love is a very silly movie , but the silliness has a pedigree .

70494 | 0.61111 | Tsai convincingly paints a specifically urban sense of disassociation here .

70508 | 0.81944 | Turturro is fabulously funny and over the top as a ` very sneaky ' butler who excels in the art of impossible disappearing\/reappearing acts
70519 | 0.75 | Two Weeks Notice has appeal beyond being a Sandra Bullock vehicle or a standard romantic comedy .
70528 | 0.47222 | Ultimate X is a ride , basically the kind of greatest-hits reel that might come with a subscription to ESPN the Magazine .
70529 | 0.68056 | Ultimately engages less for its story of actorly existential despair than for its boundary-hopping formal innovations and glimpse into another kind of Chinese ` cultural revolution . '
70530 | 0.38889 | Ultimately too repellent to fully endear itself to American art house audiences , but it is notable for its stylistic austerity and forcefulness .
70543 | 0.625 | Undoubtedly the scariest movie ever made about tattoos .

70575 | 0.76389 | Unlike most anime , whose most ardent fans outside Japan seem to be introverted young men with fantasy fetishes , Metropolis never seems hopelessly juvenile .
70581 | 0.61111 | Until it goes off the rails in its final 10 or 15 minutes , Wendigo , Larry Fessenden 's spooky new thriller , is a refreshingly smart and newfangled variation on several themes derived from far less sophisticated and knowing horror films .
70583 | 0.33333 | Until its final minutes this is a perceptive study of two families in crisis -- and of two girls whose friendship is severely tested by bad luck and their own immaturity .
70588 | 0.76389 | Using an endearing cast , writer\/director Dover Kosashvili takes a slightly dark look at relationships , both sexual and kindred .

70624 | 0.91667 | Victor Rosa is Leguizamo 's best movie work so far , a subtle and richly internalized performance .
70634 | 0.65278 | Vincent Gallo is right at home in this French shocker playing his usual bad boy weirdo role .
70639 | 0.61111 | Visually engrossing , seldom hammy , honorably Mexican and burns its Kahlories with conviction .
70643 | 0.76389 | Visually striking and viscerally repellent .

70696 | 0.79167 | Watching these two actors play against each other so intensely , but with restraint , is a treat .
70698 | 0.61111 | Watching this film , one is left with the inescapable conclusion that Hitchens ' obsession with Kissinger is , at bottom , a sophisticated flower child 's desire to purge the world of the tooth and claw of human power .
70700 | 0.76389 | Watching this gentle , mesmerizing portrait of a man coming to terms with time , you barely realize your mind is being blown .
70710 | 0.63889 | We 're drawn in by the dark luster .

70718 | 0.31944 | We do get the distinct impression that this franchise is drawing to a close .
70719 | 0.51389 | We get an image of Big Papa spanning history , rather than suspending it .
70724 | 0.79167 | We want the funk - and this movie 's got it .
70742 | 0.54167 | Weird , vulgar comedy that 's definitely an acquired taste .
70744 | 0.625 | Well , it probably wo n't have you swinging from the trees hooting it 's praises , but it 's definitely worth taking a look .

105463 | 0.70833 | Director Tom Dey demonstrated a knack for mixing action and idiosyncratic humor in his charming 2000 debut Shanghai Noon , but Showtime 's uninspired send-up of TV cop show cliches mostly leaves him shooting blanks .

105827 | 0.77778 | For a long time the film succeeds with its dark , delicate treatment of these characters and its unerring respect for them .
105829 | 0.25 | For all its brilliant touches , Dragon loses its fire midway , nearly flickering out by its perfunctory conclusion .
105831 | 0.76389 | For all its brooding quality , Ash Wednesday is suspenseful and ultimately unpredictable , with a sterling ensemble cast .
105835 | 0.25 | For all its violence , the movie is remarkably dull with only Caine making much of an impression .
105837 | 0.86111 | For all its visual panache and compelling supporting characters , the heart of the film rests in the relationship between Sullivan and his son .
105839 | 0.65278 | For all the charm of Kevin Kline and a story that puts old-fashioned values under the microscope , there 's something creepy about this movie .
105841 | 0.72222 | For all the dolorous trim , Secretary is a genial romance that maintains a surprisingly buoyant tone throughout , notwithstanding some of the writers ' sporadic dips into pop Freudianism .
105843 | 0.66667 | For almost the first two-thirds of Martin Scorsese 's 168-minute Gangs of New York , I was entranced .

106488 | 0.38889 | I just saw this movie ... well , it 's probably not accurate to call it a movie .
106494 | 0.44444 | I know we 're not supposed to take it seriously , but I ca n't shake the thought that Undercover Brother missed an opportunity to strongly present some profound social commentary .
106499 | 0.70833 | I liked a lot of the smaller scenes .
106501 | 0.65278 | I liked it just enough .
106507 | 0.20833 | I never thought I 'd say this , but I 'd much rather watch teens poking their genitals into fruit pies !
106508 | 0.5 | I prefer Soderbergh 's concentration on his two lovers over Tarkovsky 's mostly male , mostly patriarchal debating societies .
106521 | 0.27778 | I suspect that there are more interesting ways of dealing with the subject .
106529 | 0.27778 | I wanted more .
106531 | 0.80556 | I was amused and entertained by the unfolding of Bielinsky 's cleverly constructed scenario , and greatly impressed by the skill of the actors involved in the enterprise .
106533 | 0.23611 | I was feeling this movie until it veered off too far into the Exxon zone , and left me behind at the station looking for a return ticket to realism .
106538 | 0.59722 | I wo n't argue with anyone who calls ` Slackers ' dumb , insulting , or childish ... but I laughed so much that I did n't mind .
106540 | 0.55556 | I would be shocked if there was actually one correct interpretation , but that should n't make the movie or the discussion any less enjoyable .
106557 | 0.79167 | Ice Age wo n't drop your jaw , but it will warm your heart , and I 'm giving it a strong thumbs up .
106562 | 0.54167 | If Borstal Boy is n't especially realistic , it is an engaging nostalgia piece .
106573 | 0.5 | If Jews were Catholics , this would be Catechism
106575 | 0.51389 | If Signs is a good film , and it is , the essence of a great one is in there somewhere .
106577 | 0.59722 | If Sinise 's character had a brain his ordeal would be over in five minutes but instead the plot goes out of its way to introduce obstacles for him to stumble over .
106579 | 0.76389 | If The Man from Elysian Fields is doomed by its smallness , it is also elevated by it -- the kind of movie that you enjoy more because you 're one of the lucky few who sought it out .
106581 | 0.22222 | If The Tuxedo actually were a suit , it would fit Chan like a $ 99 bargain-basement special .
106583 | 0.25 | If Welles was unhappy at the prospect of the human race splitting in two , he probably would n't be too crazy with his great-grandson 's movie splitting up in pretty much the same way .
106585 | 0.66667 | If it 's not entirely memorable , the movie is certainly easy to watch .
106590 | 0.69444 | If it 's unnerving suspense you 're after -- you 'll find it with Ring , an indisputably spooky film ; with a screenplay to die for .
106592 | 0.68056 | If not a home run , then at least a solid base hit .
106594 | 0.36111 | If only Merchant paid more attention the story .
106597 | 0.61111 | If the film 's vision of sport as a secular religion is a bit cloying , its through-line of family and community is heartening in the same way that each season marks a new start .
106599 | 0.73611 | If the material is slight and admittedly manipulative , Jacquot preserves Tosca 's intoxicating ardor through his use of the camera .
106603 | 0.69444 | If the plot seems a bit on the skinny side , that 's because Panic Room is interested in nothing more than sucking you in ... and making you sweat .
106605 | 0.375 | If the predictability of bland comfort food appeals to you , then the film is a pleasant enough dish .
106607 | 0.81944 | If the real-life story is genuinely inspirational , the movie stirs us as well .
106609 | 0.5 | If the very concept makes you nervous ... you 'll have an idea of the film 's creepy , scary effectiveness .
106617 | 0.70833 | If you 're in the right B-movie frame of mind , it may just scare the pants off you .
106619 | 0.22222 | If you 're looking for a story , do n't bother .
106621 | 0.79167 | If you 're looking for an intelligent movie in which you can release your pent up anger , ENOUGH is just the ticket you need .
106623 | 0.055556 | If you 're the kind of parent who enjoys intentionally introducing your kids to films which will cause loads of irreparable damage that years and years of costly analysis could never fix , I have just one word for you - -- Decasia
106625 | 0.34722 | If you 've got a house full of tots -- do n't worry , this will be on video long before they grow up and you can wait till then .
106626 | 0.66667 | If you 've grown tired of going where no man has gone before , but several movies have - take heart .
106629 | 0.69444 | If you 've the patience , there are great rewards here .
106637 | 0.45833 | If you can keep your eyes open amid all the blood and gore , you 'll see Del Toro has brought unexpected gravity to Blade II .
106639 | 0.66667 | If you can push on through the slow spots , you 'll be rewarded with some fine acting .
106645 | 0.79167 | If you like an extreme action-packed film with a hint of humor , then Triple X marks the spot .
106649 | 0.68056 | If you think it 's a riot to see Rob Schneider in a young woman 's clothes , then you 'll enjoy The Hot Chick .
106651 | 0.59722 | If you thought Tom Hanks was just an ordinary big-screen star , wait until you 've seen him eight stories tall .
106653 | 0.16667 | If you value your time and money , find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite , predictable rehash .
106655 | 0.31944 | Ignoring that , he made Swimfan anyway
106673 | 0.27778 | Imagine the CleanFlicks version of ` Love Story , ' with Ali MacGraw 's profanities replaced by romance-novel platitudes .
106678 | 0.40278 | Impeccably filmed , sexually charged , but ultimately lacking in substance , not to mention dragged down by a leaden closing act .
106680 | 0.65278 | In Death to Smoochy , we do n't get Williams ' usual tear and a smile , just sneers and bile , and the spectacle is nothing short of refreshing .
106682 | 0.84722 | In IMAX in short , it 's just as wonderful on the big screen .
106688 | 0.81944 | In addition to scoring high for originality of plot -- putting together familiar themes of family , forgiveness and love in a new way -- Lilo & Stitch has a number of other assets to commend it to movie audiences both innocent and jaded .
106691 | 0.79167 | In an era where big stars and high production values are standard procedure , Narc strikes a defiantly retro chord , and outpaces its contemporaries with daring and verve .
106693 | 0.59722 | In capturing the understated comedic agony of an ever-ruminating , genteel yet decadent aristocracy that can no longer pay its bills , the film could just as well be addressing the turn of the 20th century into the 21st .
106698 | 0.76389 | In his latest effort , Storytelling , Solondz has finally made a movie that is n't just offensive -- it also happens to be good .
106706 | 0.58333 | In my opinion , Analyze That is not as funny or entertaining as Analyze This , but it is a respectable sequel .
106708 | 0.69444 | In the director 's cut , the film is not only a love song to the movies but it also is more fully an example of the kind of lush , all-enveloping movie experience it rhapsodizes .
106709 | 0.34722 | In the end , The Weight of Water comes to resemble the kind of soft-core twaddle you 'd expect to see on Showtime 's ` Red Shoe Diaries . '
106710 | 0.69444 | In the end , the film is less the cheap thriller you 'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters -- damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide .
106712 | 0.625 | In the end there is one word that best describes this film : honest .
106714 | 0.31944 | In the era of The Sopranos , it feels painfully redundant and inauthentic .
106716 | 0.25 | In the name of an allegedly inspiring and easily marketable flick , The Emperor 's Club turns a blind eye to the very history it pretends to teach .
106718 | 0.59722 | In the telling of a story largely untold , Bui chooses to produce something that is ultimately suspiciously familiar .
106721 | 0.31944 | In the wake of Saving Private Ryan , Black Hawk Down and We Were Soldiers , you are likely to be as heartily sick of mayhem as Cage 's war-weary marine .
106727 | 0.26389 | In theory , a middle-aged romance pairing Clayburgh and Tambor sounds promising , but in practice it 's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life .
106729 | 0.48611 | In trying to be daring and original , it comes off as only occasionally satirical and never fresh .
106731 | 0.68056 | In visual fertility Treasure Planet rivals the top Japanese animations of recent vintage .
106733 | 0.44444 | Indeed , none of these words really gets at the very special type of badness that is Deuces Wild .
106739 | 0.55556 | Innocuous enough to make even Jean-Claude Van Damme look good .
106744 | 0.5 | Insomnia does not become one of those rare remakes to eclipse the original , but it does n't disgrace it , either .
106745 | 0.22222 | Insomnia loses points when it surrenders to a formulaic bang-bang , shoot-em-up scene at the conclusion .
106750 | 0.27778 | Instead of a witty expose on the banality and hypocrisy of too much kid-vid , we get an ugly , mean-spirited lashing out by an adult who 's apparently been forced by his kids to watch too many Barney videos .
106752 | 0.29167 | Instead of building to a laugh riot we are left with a handful of disparate funny moments of no real consequence .
106760 | 0.84722 | Intensely romantic , thought-provoking and even an engaging mystery .
106761 | 0.52778 | Interesting , but not compelling .
106763 | 0.88889 | Intriguing and downright intoxicating .
106777 | 0.13889 | Irwin and his director never come up with an adequate reason why we should pay money for what we can get on television for free .
106781 | 0.30556 | Is anyone else out there getting tired of the whole slo-mo , double-pistoled , ballistic-pyrotechnic Hong Kong action aesthetic ?
106785 | 0.20833 | Is n't as sharp as the original ... Despite some visual virtues , ` Blade II ' just does n't cut it .
106790 | 0.81944 | Is not so much a work of entertainment as it is a unique , well-crafted psychological study of grief .
106797 | 0.68056 | It 's ... worth the extra effort to see an artist , still committed to growth in his ninth decade , change while remaining true to his principles with a film whose very subject is , quite pointedly , about the peril of such efforts .
106802 | 0.26389 | It 's Tommy 's job to clean the peep booths surrounding her , and after viewing this one , you 'll feel like mopping up , too .
106803 | 0.11111 | It 's a drag how Nettelbeck sees working women -- or at least this working woman -- for whom she shows little understanding .
106804 | 0.52778 | It 's a drawling , slobbering , lovable run-on sentence of a film , a Southern Gothic with the emotional arc of its raw blues soundtrack .
106806 | 0.34722 | It 's a glorified sitcom , and a long , unfunny one at that .
106811 | 0.58333 | It 's a good film , but it falls short of its aspiration to be a true ` epic ' .
106812 | 0.88889 | It 's a great American adventure and a wonderful film to bring to IMAX .
106814 | 0.83333 | It 's a rollicking adventure for you and all your mateys , regardless of their ages .
106815 | 0.73611 | It 's a scorcher .
106816 | 0.63889 | It 's a sharp movie about otherwise dull subjects .
106817 | 0.59722 | It 's a sight to behold .
106820 | 0.77778 | It 's a testament to De Niro and director Michael Caton-Jones that by movie 's end , we accept the characters and the film , flaws and all .
106821 | 0.69444 | It 's a very tasteful rock and roll movie .
106823 | 0.80556 | It 's a very valuable film ...
106827 | 0.69444 | It 's about issues most adults have to face in marriage and I think that 's what I liked about it -- the real issues tucked between the silly and crude storyline .
106828 | 0.55556 | It 's about time .
106829 | 0.43056 | It 's all pretty tame .
106831 | 0.16667 | It 's also curious to note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed Antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget .
106832 | 0.81944 | It 's always enthralling .
106833 | 0.055556 | It 's an 88-minute highlight reel that 's 86 minutes too long .
106834 | 0.55556 | It 's an actor 's showcase that accomplishes its primary goal without the use of special effects , but rather by emphasizing the characters -- including the supporting ones .
106840 | 0.76389 | It 's an entertaining movie , and the effects , boosted to the size of a downtown hotel , will all but take you to outer space .
106841 | 0.81944 | It 's an exhilarating place to visit , this laboratory of laughter .
106842 | 0.48611 | It 's an unusual , thoughtful bio-drama with a rich subject and some fantastic moments and scenes .
106843 | 0.54167 | It 's better than mid-range Steven Seagal , but not as sharp as Jet Li on rollerblades .
106844 | 0.48611 | It 's clear that Mehta simply wanted to update her beloved genre for the thousands of Indians who fancy themselves too sophisticated for the cheese-laced spectacles that pack 'em in on the subcontinent .
106845 | 0.11111 | It 's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long .
106852 | 0.86111 | It 's dark but has wonderfully funny moments ; you care about the characters ; and the action and special effects are first-rate .
106853 | 0.76389 | It 's definitely a step in the right direction .
106863 | 0.52778 | It 's easy to be cynical about documentaries in which underdogs beat the odds and the human spirit triumphs , but Westbrook 's foundation and Dalrymple 's film earn their uplift .
106868 | 0.38889 | It 's easy to love Robin Tunney -- she 's pretty and she can act -- but it gets harder and harder to understand her choices .
106869 | 0.70833 | It 's enough to watch Huppert scheming , with her small , intelligent eyes as steady as any noir villain , and to enjoy the perfectly pitched web of tension that Chabrol spins .
106874 | 0.73611 | It 's excessively quirky and a little underconfident in its delivery , but otherwise this is the best ` old neighborhood ' project since Christopher Walken kinda romanced Cyndi Lauper in The Opportunists .
106880 | 0.72222 | It 's got all the familiar Bruckheimer elements , and Schumacher does probably as good a job as anyone at bringing off the Hopkins\/Rock collision of acting styles and onscreen personas .
106881 | 0.31944 | It 's got the brawn , but not the brains .
106883 | 0.15278 | It 's hard to imagine any recent film , independent or otherwise , that makes as much of a mess as this one .
106884 | 0.36111 | It 's impossible to even categorize this as a smutty guilty pleasure .
106885 | 0.45833 | It 's just a little too self-satisfied .
106886 | 0.375 | It 's just not very smart .
106887 | 0.18056 | It 's just too bad the screenwriters eventually shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer , squad car pile-ups and the requisite screaming captain .
106892 | 0.375 | It 's like Rocky and Bullwinkle on Speed , but that 's neither completely enlightening , nor does it catch the intensity of the movie 's strangeness .
106894 | 0.22222 | It 's like an all-star salute to Disney 's cheesy commercialism .
106903 | 0.34722 | It 's mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar American style of justice that plays out here , but it 's so muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through .
106904 | 0.66667 | It 's more enjoyable than I expected , though , and that 's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs .
106910 | 0.66667 | It 's never laugh-out-loud funny , but it is frequently amusing .
106916 | 0.79167 | It 's nice to see Piscopo again after all these years , and Chaykin and Headly are priceless .
106917 | 0.15278 | It 's not a bad premise , just a bad movie .
106922 | 0.55556 | It 's not a film to be taken literally on any level , but its focus always appears questionable .
106923 | 0.41667 | It 's not difficult to spot the culprit early-on in this predictable thriller .
106925 | 0.48611 | It 's not exactly worth the bucks to expend the full price for a date , but when it comes out on video , it 's well worth a rental .
106926 | 0.51389 | It 's not hateful .
106932 | 0.63889 | It 's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time .
106938 | 0.65278 | It 's not particularly well made , but since I found myself howling more than cringing , I 'd say the film works .
106939 | 0.31944 | It 's not so much a movie as a joint promotion for the National Basketball Association and teenaged rap and adolescent poster-boy Lil ' Bow Wow .
106941 | 0.13889 | It 's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish .
106942 | 0.069444 | It 's probably not easy to make such a worthless film ...
106947 | 0.77778 | It 's rare to find a film to which the adjective ` gentle ' applies , but the word perfectly describes Pauline & Paulette .
106949 | 0.097222 | It 's simply stupid , irrelevant and deeply , truly , bottomlessly cynical .
106950 | 0.44444 | It 's sincere to a fault , but , unfortunately , not very compelling or much fun .
106952 | 0.5 | It 's so laddish and juvenile , only teenage boys could possibly find it funny .
106953 | 0.56944 | It 's sobering , particularly if anyone still thinks this conflict can be resolved easily , or soon .
106954 | 0.63889 | It 's sort of a 21st century morality play with a Latino hip hop beat .
106961 | 0.84722 | It 's sweet , funny , charming , and completely delightful .
106968 | 0.16667 | It 's the element of condescension , as the filmmakers look down on their working-class subjects from their lofty perch , that finally makes Sex With Strangers , which opens today in the New York metropolitan area , so distasteful .
106969 | 0.80556 | It 's the kind of effectively creepy-scary thriller that has you fixating on a far corner of the screen at times because your nerves just ca n't take it any more .
106973 | 0.40278 | It 's the type of stunt the Academy loves : a powerful political message stuffed into an otherwise mediocre film .
106974 | 0.54167 | It 's the unsettling images of a war-ravaged land that prove more potent and riveting than the unlikely story of Sarah and Harrison .
106975 | 0.41667 | It 's too bad that the rest is n't more compelling .
106978 | 0.72222 | It 's unlikely we 'll see a better thriller this year .
106979 | 0.51389 | It 's up to you to decide whether to admire these people 's dedication to their cause or be repelled by their dogmatism , manipulativeness and narrow , fearful view of American life .
106980 | 0.83333 | It 's worth taking the kids to .
106983 | 0.20833 | It all looks and plays like a $ 40 million version of a game you 're more likely to enjoy on a computer .
106984 | 0.44444 | It arrives with an impeccable pedigree , mongrel pep , and almost indecipherable plot complications .
106985 | 0.79167 | It can be safely recommended as a video\/DVD babysitter .
106989 | 0.66667 | It certainly wo n't win any awards in the plot department but it sets out with no pretensions and delivers big time .
106990 | 0.45833 | It comes off as so silly that you would n't be surprised if BA , Murdock and rest of the A-Team were seen giving chase in a black and red van .
106991 | 0.76389 | It deserves to be seen everywhere .
106996 | 0.36111 | It does n't make for great cinema , but it is interesting to see where one 's imagination will lead when given the opportunity .
106997 | 0.63889 | It does n't matter that the film is less than 90 minutes .
106999 | 0.125 | It does n't work as either .
107001 | 0.22222 | It finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers .
107004 | 0.44444 | It gets bogged down by hit-and-miss topical humour before getting to the truly good stuff .
107005 | 0.69444 | It has a dashing and resourceful hero ; a lisping , reptilian villain ; big fights ; big hair ; lavish period scenery ; and a story just complicated enough to let you bask in your own cleverness as you figure it out .
107007 | 0.22222 | It hates its characters .
107012 | 0.83333 | It is different from others in its genre in that it is does not rely on dumb gags , anatomical humor , or character cliches ; it primarily relies on character to tell its story .
107013 | 0.76389 | It is hard not to be especially grateful for freedom after a film like this .
107014 | 0.70833 | It is life affirming and heartbreaking , sweet without the decay factor , funny and sad .
107015 | 0.11111 | It is messy , uncouth , incomprehensible , vicious and absurd .
107018 | 0.11111 | It is not the first time that director Sara Sugarman stoops to having characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time she fails to provoke them .
107020 | 0.041667 | It is that rare combination of bad writing , bad direction and bad acting -- the trifecta of badness .
107025 | 0.11111 | It is very difficult to care about the character , and that is the central flaw of the film .
107028 | 0.91667 | It leaves little doubt that Kidman has become one of our best actors .
107029 | 0.27778 | It leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject .
107030 | 0.11111 | It looks like an action movie , but it 's so poorly made , on all levels , that it does n't even qualify as a spoof of such .
107032 | 0.625 | It may ... work as a jaunt down memory lane for teens and young adults who grew up on televised Scooby-Doo shows or reruns .
107037 | 0.68056 | It may be a no-brainer , but at least it 's a funny no-brainer .
107047 | 0.72222 | It may not be particularly innovative , but the film 's crisp , unaffected style and air of gentle longing make it unexpectedly rewarding .
107050 | 0.69444 | It offers a glimpse of the Solomonic decision facing Jewish parents in those turbulent times : to save their children and yet to lose them .
107052 | 0.56944 | It pulls the rug out from under you , just when you 're ready to hate one character , or really sympathize with another character , something happens to send you off in different direction .
107053 | 0.70833 | It rapidly develops into a gut-wrenching examination of the way cultural differences and emotional expectations collide .
107054 | 0.51389 | It says a lot about a filmmaker when he can be wacky without clobbering the audience over the head and still maintain a sense of urgency and suspense .
107059 | 0.70833 | It seems impossible that an epic four-hour Indian musical about a cricket game could be this good , but it is .
107060 | 0.20833 | It should have stayed there .
107061 | 0.069444 | It shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there 's a little girl-on-girl action .
107063 | 0.30556 | It still feels like a prison stretch .
107073 | 0.61111 | It uses some of the figures from the real-life story to portray themselves in the film .
107075 | 0.56944 | It was filled with shootings , beatings , and more cussing than you could shake a stick at .
107077 | 0.58333 | It will break your heart many times over .
107078 | 0.875 | It will guarantee to have you leaving the theater with a smile on your face .
107080 | 0.90278 | It works its magic with such exuberance and passion that the film 's length becomes a part of its fun .
107085 | 0.13889 | It would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in Dragonfly , yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction .
107089 | 0.51389 | It wraps up a classic mother\/daughter struggle in recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while the audience can tell it 's not all new , at least it looks pretty .
107097 | 0.73611 | Its compelling mix of trial movie , escape movie and unexpected fable ensures the film never feels draggy .

108263 | 0.59722 | Overall , it 's a wacky and inspired little film that works effortlessly at delivering genuine , acerbic laughs .
108271 | 0.29167 | PC stability notwithstanding , the film suffers from a simplistic narrative and a pat , fairy-tale conclusion .
108274 | 0.73611 | Paid in Full is remarkably engaging despite being noticeably derivative of Goodfellas and at least a half dozen other trouble-in-the-ghetto flicks .
108276 | 0.86111 | Painful , horrifying and oppressively tragic , this film should not be missed .
108288 | 0.31944 | Parents beware ; this is downright movie penance .
108293 | 0.56944 | Parker should be commended for taking a fresh approach to familiar material , but his determination to remain true to the original text leads him to adopt a somewhat mannered tone ... that ultimately dulls the human tragedy at the story 's core .
108294 | 0.38889 | Parker updates the setting in an attempt to make the film relevant today , without fully understanding what it was that made the story relevant in the first place .
108296 | 0.81944 | Part of the film 's cheeky charm comes from its vintage schmaltz .
108298 | 0.11111 | Partly a schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless .
108300 | 0.23611 | Parts of the film feel a bit too much like an infomercial for Ram Dass 's latest book aimed at the boomer demographic .
108319 | 0.79167 | Passion , melodrama , sorrow , laugther , and tears cascade over the screen effortlessly ...
108332 | 0.48611 | Paxton 's uneven directorial debut fails to unlock the full potential of what is in many ways a fresh and dramatically substantial spin on the genre .
108342 | 0.27778 | Payami tries to raise some serious issues about Iran 's electoral process , but the result is a film that 's about as subtle as a party political broadcast .
108350 | 0.80556 | Peppered with witty dialogue and inventive moments .
108353 | 0.47222 | Peralta 's mythmaking could have used some informed , adult hindsight .
108354 | 0.84722 | Peralta captures , in luminous interviews and amazingly evocative film from three decades ago , the essence of the Dogtown experience .
108360 | 0.59722 | Performances are potent , and the women 's stories are ably intercut and involving .
108364 | 0.86111 | Pete 's screenplay manages to find that real natural , even-flowing tone that few movies are able to accomplish .
108371 | 0.875 | Peter Jackson and company once again dazzle and delight us , fulfilling practically every expectation either a longtime Tolkien fan or a movie-going neophyte could want .
108393 | 0.79167 | Piercingly affecting ... while clearly a manipulative film , emerges as powerful rather than cloying .
108409 | 0.30556 | Pleasant but not more than recycled jock piffle .
108411 | 0.083333 | Please , someone , stop Eric Schaeffer before he makes another film .
108415 | 0.20833 | Plodding , peevish and gimmicky .
108416 | 0 | Plodding , poorly written , murky and weakly acted , the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo .
108420 | 0.013889 | Plotless collection of moronic stunts is by far the worst movie of the year .
108427 | 0.69444 | Plunges you into a reality that is , more often then not , difficult and sad , and then , without sentimentalizing it or denying its brutality , transforms that reality into a lyrical and celebratory vision .
108438 | 0.63889 | Poignant if familiar story of a young person suspended between two cultures .
108445 | 0.81944 | Polanski has found the perfect material with which to address his own World War II experience in his signature style .
108459 | 0.45833 | Possibly not since Grumpy Old Men have I heard a film so solidly connect with one demographic while striking out with another .
108460 | 0.27778 | Possibly the most irresponsible picture ever released by a major film studio .
108464 | 0.625 | Pratfalls aside , Barbershop gets its greatest play from the timeless spectacle of people really talking to each other .
108471 | 0.33333 | Predecessors The Mummy and The Mummy Returns stand as intellectual masterpieces next to The Scorpion King .
108472 | 0.76389 | Presents a side of contemporary Chinese life that many outsiders will be surprised to know exists , and does so with an artistry that also smacks of revelation .
108481 | 0.72222 | Promises is a compelling piece that demonstrates just how well children can be trained to live out and carry on their parents ' anguish .
108484 | 0.65278 | Proves a servicable World War II drama that ca n't totally hide its contrivances , but it at least calls attention to a problem Hollywood too long has ignored .
108487 | 0.58333 | Provides a porthole into that noble , trembling incoherence that defines us all .
108507 | 0.40278 | Pure of intention and passably diverting , His Secret Life is light , innocuous and unremarkable .
108509 | 0.33333 | Puts on airs of a Hal Hartley wannabe film -- without the vital comic ingredient of the hilarious writer-director himself .
108514 | 0.36111 | Putting the primitive murderer inside a high-tech space station unleashes a Pandora 's Box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest .
108524 | 0.69444 | Quiet , adult and just about more stately than any contemporary movie this year ... a true study , a film with a questioning heart and mind that is n't afraid to admit it does n't have all the answers .
108528 | 0.16667 | Quite frankly , I ca n't see why any actor of talent would ever work in a McCulloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out .
108539 | 0.86111 | Raimi crafted a complicated hero who is a welcome relief from the usual two-dimensional offerings .
108551 | 0.73611 | Ramsay and Morton fill this character study with poetic force and buoyant feeling .
108555 | 0.75 | Rarely has skin looked as beautiful , desirable , even delectable , as it does in Trouble Every Day .
108560 | 0.86111 | Read My Lips is to be viewed and treasured for its extraordinary intelligence and originality as well as its lyrical variations on the game of love .
108562 | 0.33333 | Really does feel like a short stretched out to feature length .
108565 | 0.55556 | Recoing 's fantastic performance does n't exactly reveal what makes Vincent tick , but perhaps any definitive explanation for it would have felt like a cheat .
108569 | 0.5 | Red Dragon makes one appreciate Silence of the Lambs .
108574 | 0.45833 | Reeks of rot and hack work from start to finish .
108580 | 0.75 | Reggio and Glass put on an intoxicating show .
108581 | 0.27778 | Reggio and Glass so rhapsodize cynicism , with repetition and languorous slo-mo sequences , that Glass 's dirgelike score becomes a fang-baring lullaby .
108584 | 0.93056 | Remarkable for its excellent storytelling , its economical , compressed characterisations and for its profound humanity , it 's an adventure story and history lesson all in one .
108586 | 0.84722 | Remarkable for its intelligence and intensity .
108590 | 0.68056 | Reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock 's thrillers , most of the scary parts in ` Signs ' occur while waiting for things to happen .
108599 | 0.41667 | Reno does what he can in a thankless situation , the film ricochets from humor to violence and back again , and Ryoko Hirosue makes us wonder if she is always like that .
108605 | 0.76389 | Represents a worthy departure from the culture clash comedies that have marked an emerging Indian American cinema .
108609 | 0.33333 | Resembles a soft porn Brian De Palma pastiche .
108612 | 0.30556 | Resident Evil is n't a product of its cinematic predecessors so much as an MTV , sugar hysteria , and PlayStation cocktail .
108618 | 0.66667 | Return to Never Land may be another shameless attempt by Disney to rake in dough from baby boomer families , but it 's not half-bad .
108624 | 0.31944 | Rice is too pedestrian a filmmaker to bring any edge or personality to The Rising Place that would set it apart from other Deep South stories .
108626 | 0.70833 | Rich in atmosphere of the post-war art world , it manages to instruct without reeking of research library dust .
108646 | 0.86111 | Road to Perdition does display greatness , and it 's worth seeing .
108665 | 0.84722 | Robinson 's web of suspense matches the page-turning frenzy that Clancy creates .
108669 | 0.69444 | Rodriguez does a splendid job of racial profiling Hollywood style -- casting excellent Latin actors of all ages -- a trend long overdue .
108681 | 0.86111 | Romantic , riveting and handsomely animated .
108704 | 0.68056 | Russian Ark is a new treasure of the Hermitage .
108713 | 0.20833 | Rymer does n't trust laughs -- and does n't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects .
108718 | 0.58333 | Ryosuke has created a wry , winning , if languidly paced , meditation on the meaning and value of family .
108730 | 0.25 | Sadly , Full Frontal plays like the work of a dilettante .
108731 | 0.25 | Sadly , though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear , they ca n't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction .
108765 | 0.77778 | Satisfyingly scarifying , fresh and old-fashioned at the same time .
108769 | 0.48611 | Saved from being merely way-cool by a basic , credible compassion .
108777 | 0.375 | Sayles ... once again strands his superb performers in the same old story .
108778 | 0.84722 | Sayles has a knack for casting , often resurrecting performers who rarely work in movies now ... and drawing flavorful performances from bland actors .
108786 | 0.76389 | Schaeffer is n't in this film , which may be why it works as well as it does .
108791 | 0.86111 | Scherfig 's light-hearted profile of emotional desperation is achingly honest and delightfully cheeky .
108808 | 0.44444 | Schneider 's mugging is relentless and his constant need to suddenly transpose himself into another character undermines the story 's continuity and progression .
108809 | 0.69444 | Schrader examines Crane 's decline with unblinking candor .
108832 | 0.083333 | Seagal ran out of movies years ago , and this is just the proof .
108849 | 0.55556 | Sensitively examines general issues of race and justice among the poor , and specifically raises serious questions about the death penalty and asks what good the execution of a mentally challenged woman could possibly do .
108854 | 0.84722 | Serious movie-goers embarking upon this journey will find that The Road to Perdition leads to a satisfying destination .
108857 | 0.26389 | Serving Sara is little more than a mall movie designed to kill time .
108861 | 0.055556 | Sets animation back 30 years , musicals back 40 years and Judaism back at least 50 .
108872 | 0.83333 | Sex With Strangers is fascinating ...
108881 | 0.44444 | Shadyac , who belongs with the damned for perpetrating Patch Adams , trots out every ghost trick from The Sixth Sense to The Mothman Prophecies .
108890 | 0.68056 | Shanghai Ghetto , much stranger than any fiction , brings this unknown slice of history affectingly to life .
108895 | 0.84722 | Shanghai Ghetto may not be as dramatic as Roman Polanski 's The Pianist , but its compassionate spirit soars every bit as high .
108903 | 0.81944 | She 's as rude and profane as ever , always hilarious and , most of the time , absolutely right in her stinging social observations .
108912 | 0.33333 | Sheridan had a wonderful account to work from , but , curiously , he waters it down , turning grit and vulnerability into light reading .
108913 | 0.65278 | Shiner can certainly go the distance , but is n't world championship material
108919 | 0.81944 | Shot largely in small rooms , the film has a gentle , unforced intimacy that never becomes claustrophobic .
108930 | 0.70833 | Shyamalan offers copious hints along the way -- myriad signs , if you will -- that beneath the familiar , funny surface is a far bigger , far more meaningful story than one in which little green men come to Earth for harvesting purposes .
108941 | 0.72222 | Significantly better than its 2002 children 's - movie competition .
108950 | 0.51389 | Silly , loud and goofy .
108954 | 0.34722 | Silly stuff , all mixed up together like a term paper from a kid who ca n't quite distinguish one sci-fi work from another .
108964 | 0.29167 | Simplistic , silly and tedious .
108965 | 0.29167 | Simply put , there should have been a more compelling excuse to pair Susan Sarandon and Goldie Hawn .
108970 | 0.58333 | Simultaneously heartbreakingly beautiful and exquisitely sad .
108973 | 0.22222 | Since Dahmer resorts to standard slasher flick thrills when it should be most in the mind of the killer , it misses a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche .
108992 | 0.70833 | Skin Of Man gets a few cheap shocks from its kids-in-peril theatrics , but it also taps into the primal fears of young people trying to cope with the mysterious and brutal nature of adults .
108998 | 0.11111 | Skip the film and buy the Philip Glass soundtrack CD .
109004 | 0.69444 | Sly , sophisticated and surprising .
109007 | 0.72222 | Smarter than its commercials make it seem .
109008 | 0.66667 | Smith examines the intimate , unguarded moments of folks who live in unusual homes -- which pop up in nearly every corner of the country .
109009 | 0.625 | Smith finds amusing juxtapositions that justify his exercise .
109014 | 0.43056 | Smothered by its own solemnity .
109022 | 0.94444 | So beautifully acted and directed , it 's clear that Washington most certainly has a new career ahead of him if he so chooses .
109025 | 0.27778 | So mind-numbingly awful that you hope Britney wo n't do it one more time , as far as movies are concerned .
109026 | 0.45833 | So riddled with unanswered questions that it requires gargantuan leaps of faith just to watch it plod along .
109030 | 0.54167 | So unique and stubborn and charismatic that you want it to be better and more successful than it is .
109034 | 0.80556 | Soderbergh , like Kubrick before him , may not touch the planet 's skin , but understands the workings of its spirit .
109035 | 0.55556 | Soderbergh seems capable only of delivering artfully lighted , earnest inquiries that lack the kind of genuine depth that would make them redeemable .
109044 | 0.51389 | Solondz creates some effective moments of discomfort for character and viewer alike .
109047 | 0.22222 | Some Body often looks like an episode of the TV show Blind Date , only less technically proficient and without the pop-up comments .
109048 | 0.66667 | Some Body will take you places you have n't been , and also places you have .
109051 | 0.33333 | Some episodes work , some do n't .
109064 | 0.34722 | Some of the computer animation is handsome , and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale , but overall the film never rises above mediocrity .
109070 | 0.80556 | Some of the visual flourishes are a little too obvious , but restrained and subtle storytelling , and fine performances make this delicate coming-of-age tale a treat .
109077 | 0.61111 | Sometimes charming , sometimes infuriating , this Argentinean ` dramedy ' succeeds mainly on the shoulders of its actors .
109078 | 0.30556 | Sometimes there are very , very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely .
109083 | 0.45833 | Sometimes this modest little number clicks , and sometimes it does n't .
109088 | 0.5 | Sometimes we feel as if the film careens from one colorful event to another without respite , but sometimes it must have seemed to Frida Kahlo as if her life did , too .
109094 | 0.58333 | Somewhere in the middle , the film compels , as Demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems , but the field of roughage dominates .
109112 | 0.69444 | Spare but quietly effective retelling .
109120 | 0.38889 | Spider-Man is about growing strange hairs , getting a more mature body , and finding it necessary to hide new secretions from the parental units .
109131 | 0.66667 | Splendidly illustrates the ability of the human spirit to overcome adversity .
109135 | 0.88889 | Spy Kids 2 also happens to be that rarity among sequels : It actually improves upon the original hit movie .
109149 | 0.375 | Stale first act , Scrooge story , blatant product placement , some very good comedic songs , strong finish , dumb fart jokes .
109150 | 0.875 | Standing in the Shadows of Motown is the best kind of documentary , one that makes a depleted yesterday feel very much like a brand-new tomorrow .
109166 | 0.375 | Star Trek was kind of terrific once , but now it is a copy of a copy of a copy .
109173 | 0.72222 | Steadfastly uncinematic but powerfully dramatic .

109182 | 0.83333 | Steers , in his feature film debut , has created a brilliant motion picture .
109190 | 0.31944 | Steven Soderbergh does n't remake Andrei Tarkovsky 's Solaris so much as distill it .
109197 | 0.88889 | Still rapturous after all these years , Cinema Paradiso stands as one of the great films about movie love .
109203 | 0.31944 | Stinks from start to finish , like a wet burlap sack of gloom .
109207 | 0.44444 | Stirs potentially enticing ingredients into an uneasy blend of Ghost and Close Encounters of the Third Kind .
109212 | 0.375 | Stone seems to have a knack for wrapping the theater in a cold blanket of urban desperation .
109224 | 0.77778 | Straightforward and old-fashioned in the best possible senses of both those words , Possession is a movie that puts itself squarely in the service of the lovers who inhabit it .
109226 | 0.61111 | Strangely comes off as a kingdom more mild than wild .
109234 | 0.33333 | Stripped almost entirely of such tools as nudity , profanity and violence , LaBute does manage to make a few points about modern man and his problematic quest for human connection .
109242 | 0.69444 | Successfully blended satire , high camp and yet another sexual taboo into a really funny movie .
109245 | 0.13889 | Such a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the show .
109247 | 0.11111 | Such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema .
109257 | 0.16667 | Suffers from a lack of clarity and audacity that a subject as monstrous and pathetic as Dahmer demands .
109260 | 0.30556 | Suffers from its timid parsing of the barn-side target of sons trying to breach gaps in their relationships with their fathers .
109262 | 0.16667 | Suffers from over-familiarity since hit-hungry British filmmakers have strip-mined the Monty formula mercilessly since 1997 .
109277 | 0.22222 | Supposedly , Pokemon ca n't be killed , but Pokemon 4Ever practically assures that the pocket monster movie franchise is nearly ready to keel over .
109278 | 0.34722 | Sure , I hated myself in the morning .
109283 | 0.34722 | Surprisingly , considering that Baird is a former film editor , the movie is rather choppy .
109284 | 0.73611 | Surprisingly , the film is a hilarious adventure and I shamelessly enjoyed it .
109307 | 0.70833 | Symbolically , Warm Water Under a Red Bridge is a celebration of feminine energy , a tribute to the power of women to heal .
109320 | 0.16667 | Take away the controversy , and it 's not much more watchable than a Mexican soap opera .
109325 | 0.63889 | Take nothing seriously and enjoy the ride .
109333 | 0.59722 | Takes one character we do n't like and another we do n't believe , and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and is n't very funny .
109339 | 0.66667 | Talk To Her is not the perfect movie many have made it out to be , but it 's still quite worth seeing .
109347 | 0.15278 | Talky , artificial and opaque ... an interesting technical exercise , but a tedious picture .
109363 | 0.83333 | Tells a fascinating , compelling story .
109370 | 0.11111 | Terminally brain dead production .
109373 | 0.59722 | Thanks to Ice Cube , Benjamins feels an awful lot like Friday in Miami .
109379 | 0.81944 | That Haynes can both maintain and dismantle the facades that his genre and his character construct is a wonderous accomplishment of veracity and narrative grace .
109381 | 0.81944 | That Jack Nicholson makes this man so watchable is a tribute not only to his craft , but to his legend .
109384 | 0.51389 | That is because - damn it !
109395 | 0.68056 | That the e-graveyard holds as many good ideas as bad is the cold comfort that Chin 's film serves up with style and empathy .
109401 | 0.91667 | The 3-D vistas from orbit , with the space station suspended like a huge set of wind chimes over the great blue globe , are stanzas of breathtaking , awe-inspiring visual poetry .
109403 | 0.18056 | The 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about .
109407 | 0.19444 | The Adventures of Pluto Nash is a whole lot of nada .
109415 | 0.45833 | The Emperor 's Club is one of those films that possesses all the good intentions in the world , but ...
109421 | 0.68056 | The Four Feathers is definitely horse feathers , but if you go in knowing that , you might have fun in this cinematic sandbox .
109424 | 0.11111 | The French director has turned out nearly 21\/2 hours of unfocused , excruciatingly tedious cinema that , half an hour in , starts making water torture seem appealing .
109432 | 0.38889 | The Good Girl is a film in which the talent is undeniable but the results are underwhelming .
109435 | 0.66667 | The Importance of Being Earnest , so thick with wit it plays like a reading from Bartlett 's Familiar Quotations
109437 | 0.51389 | The Lady and the Duke is Eric Rohmer 's economical antidote to the bloated costume drama
109438 | 0.73611 | The Lady and the Duke is a smart , romantic drama that dares to depict the French Revolution from the aristocrats ' perspective .
109447 | 0.20833 | The Master of Disguise represents Adam Sandler 's latest attempt to dumb down the universe .
109454 | 0.41667 | The Pianist lacks the quick emotional connections of Steven Spielberg 's Schindler 's List .
109458 | 0.30556 | The Piano Teacher , like its title character , is repellantly out of control .
109459 | 0.38889 | The Piano Teacher is not an easy film .
109468 | 0.27778 | The Pool drowned me in boredom .
109480 | 0.625 | The Salton Sea has moments of inspired humour , though every scrap is of the darkest variety .
109505 | 0.26389 | The Tuxedo was n't just bad ; it was , as my friend David Cross would call it , ` Hungry-Man portions of bad ' .
109510 | 0.66667 | The Way Home is an ode to unconditional love and compassion garnered from years of seeing it all , a condition only the old are privy to , and ... often misconstrued as weakness .
109518 | 0.68056 | The Wild Thornberrys Movie has all the sibling rivalry and general family chaos to which anyone can relate .
109522 | 0.75 | The Wild Thornberrys Movie is pleasant enough and the message of our close ties with animals can certainly not be emphasized enough .
109529 | 0.66667 | The acting , for the most part , is terrific , although the actors must struggle with the fact that they 're playing characters who sometimes feel more like literary conceits than flesh-and-blood humans .
109531 | 0.81944 | The acting in Pauline And Paulette is good all round , but what really sets the film apart is Debrauwer 's refusal to push the easy emotional buttons .
109535 | 0.31944 | The acting is fine but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the Wal-Mart checkout line .
109536 | 0.19444 | The acting is n't much better .
109541 | 0.59722 | The action is reasonably well-done ... yet story , character and comedy bits are too ragged to ever fit smoothly together .
109546 | 0.72222 | The action sequences are fun and reminiscent of combat scenes from the Star Wars series .
109547 | 0.22222 | The actors must indeed be good to recite some of this laughable dialogue with a straight face .
109552 | 0.44444 | The actresses may have worked up a back story for the women they portray so convincingly , but viewers do n't get enough of that background for the characters to be involving as individuals rather than types .
109557 | 0.875 | The animated sequences are well done and perfectly constructed to convey a sense of childhood imagination and creating adventure out of angst .
109560 | 0.11111 | The animation and game phenomenon that peaked about three years ago is actually dying a slow death , if the poor quality of Pokemon 4 Ever is any indication .
109568 | 0.91667 | The art direction and costumes are gorgeous and finely detailed , and Kurys ' direction is clever and insightful .
109573 | 0.875 | The art direction is often exquisite , and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual DVD release will offer subtitles and the original Italian-language soundtrack .
109578 | 0.86111 | The artwork is spectacular and unlike most animaton from Japan , the characters move with grace and panache .
109581 | 0.75 | The attraction between these two marginal characters is complex from the start -- and , refreshingly , stays that way .
109584 | 0.72222 | The banter between Calvin and his fellow barbers feels like a streetwise McLaughlin Group ... and never fails to entertain .
109586 | 0.20833 | The basic premise is intriguing but quickly becomes distasteful and downright creepy .
109589 | 0.61111 | The beauty of Alexander Payne 's ode to the Everyman is in the details .
109591 | 0.76389 | The beauty of the piece is that it counts heart as important as humor .
109594 | 0.80556 | The best comedy concert movie I 've seen since Cho 's previous concert comedy film , I 'm the One That I Want , in 2000 .
109602 | 0.79167 | The best film of the year 2002 .
109604 | 0.79167 | The best movie in many a moon about the passions that sometimes fuel our best achievements and other times leave us stranded with nothing more than our lesser appetites .
109609 | 0.875 | The best thing I can say about this film is that I ca n't wait to see what the director does next .
109611 | 0.45833 | The best thing that can be said of the picture is that it does have a few cute moments .
109613 | 0.70833 | The big ending surprise almost saves the movie .
109616 | 0.18056 | The big-screen Scooby makes the silly original cartoon seem smart and well-crafted in comparison .
109618 | 0.13889 | The biggest problem with Roger Avary 's uproar against the MPAA is that , even in all its director 's cut glory , he 's made a film that 's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything .
109624 | 0.44444 | The bland outweighs the nifty , and Cletis Tout never becomes the clever crime comedy it thinks it is .
109630 | 0.40278 | The boys ' sparring , like the succession of blows dumped on Guei , wears down the story 's more cerebral , and likable , plot elements .
109641 | 0.51389 | The cameo-packed , M : I-2-spoofing title sequence is the funniest 5 minutes to date in this spy comedy franchise ... Then Mike Myers shows up and ruins everything .
109644 | 0.61111 | The cast ... keeps this pretty watchable , and casting Mick Jagger as director of the escort service was inspired .
109645 | 0.88889 | The cast is phenomenal , especially the women .
109654 | 0.125 | The characters are never more than sketches ... which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach .
109657 | 0.63889 | The charms of the lead performances allow us to forget most of the film 's problems .
109660 | 0.76389 | The closest thing to the experience of space travel
109662 | 0.36111 | The code talkers deserved better than a hollow tribute .
109669 | 0.75 | The color sense of Stuart Little 2 is its most immediate and most obvious pleasure , but it would count for very little if the movie were n't as beautifully shaped and as delicately calibrated in tone as it is .
109671 | 0.56944 | The comedy makes social commentary more palatable .
109674 | 0.72222 | The complex , politically charged tapestry of contemporary Chinese life this exciting new filmmaker has brought to the screen is like nothing we Westerners have seen before .
109680 | 0.66667 | The creative animation work may not look as fully ` rendered ' as Pixar 's industry standard , but it uses lighting effects and innovative backgrounds to an equally impressive degree .
109682 | 0.27778 | The criticism never rises above easy , cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters ...
109685 | 0.125 | The cumulative effect of the movie is repulsive and depressing .
109694 | 0.81944 | The determination of Pinochet 's victims to seek justice , and their often heartbreaking testimony , spoken directly into director Patricio Guzman 's camera , pack a powerful emotional wallop .
109696 | 0.29167 | The dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed .
109700 | 0.31944 | The direction , by George Hickenlooper , has no snap to it , no wiseacre crackle or hard-bitten cynicism .
109705 | 0.27778 | The direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence , but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why .
109712 | 0.47222 | The director and her capable cast appear to be caught in a heady whirl of New Age-inspired good intentions , but the spell they cast is n't the least bit mesmerizing .
109713 | 0.40278 | The director has injected self-consciousness into the proceedings at every turn .
109716 | 0.68056 | The dirty jokes provide the funniest moments in this oddly sweet comedy about jokester highway patrolmen .
109719 | 0.15278 | The drama was so uninspiring that even a story immersed in love , lust , and sin could n't keep my attention .
109725 | 0.59722 | The dramatic crisis does n't always succeed in its quest to be taken seriously , but Huppert 's volatile performance makes for a riveting movie experience .
109727 | 0.86111 | The early and middle passages are surprising in how much they engage and even touch us .
109739 | 0.19444 | The effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it 's hardly watchable .
109741 | 0.38889 | The end result is like cold porridge with only the odd enjoyably chewy lump .
109742 | 0.61111 | The ending feels at odds with the rest of the film .
109744 | 0.63889 | The engagingly primitive animated special effects contribute to a mood that 's sustained through the surprisingly somber conclusion .
109749 | 0.59722 | The entire movie has a truncated feeling , but what 's available is lovely and lovable .
109750 | 0.11111 | The entire movie is so formulaic and forgettable that it 's hardly over before it begins to fade from memory .
109753 | 0.29167 | The events of the film are just so WEIRD that I honestly never knew what the hell was coming next .
109755 | 0.43056 | The execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that Rob Schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl .
109761 | 0.51389 | The farcical elements seemed too pat and familiar to hold my interest , yet its diverting grim message is a good one .
109763 | 0.63889 | The film 's appeal has a lot to do with the casting of Juliette Binoche as Sand , who brings to the role her pale , dark beauty and characteristic warmth .
109765 | 0.41667 | The film 's best trick is the way that it treats conspiracy as a kind of political Blair Witch , a monstrous murk that haunts us precisely because it can never be seen .
109767 | 0.33333 | The film 's desire to be liked sometimes undermines the possibility for an exploration of the thornier aspects of the nature\/nurture argument in regards to homosexuality .
109769 | 0.625 | The film 's gamble to occasionally break up the live-action scenes with animated sequences pays off , as does its sensitive handling of some delicate subject matter .
109771 | 0.55556 | The film 's heady yet far from impenetrable theory suggests that Russians take comfort in their closed-off nationalist reality .
109773 | 0.70833 | The film 's images give a backbone to the company and provide an emotional edge to its ultimate demise .
109775 | 0.56944 | The film 's overall mood and focus is interesting but constantly unfulfilling .
109781 | 0.68056 | The film becomes an overwhelming pleasure , and you find yourself rooting for Gai 's character to avoid the fate that has befallen every other Carmen before her .
109782 | 0.84722 | The film boasts dry humor and jarring shocks , plus moments of breathtaking mystery .
109783 | 0.22222 | The film can depress you about life itself .
109784 | 0.70833 | The film does give a pretty good overall picture of the situation in Laramie following the murder of Matthew Shepard .
109789 | 0.77778 | The film fearlessly gets under the skin of the people involved ... This makes it not only a detailed historical document , but an engaging and moving portrait of a subculture .
109790 | 0.11111 | The film feels formulaic , its plot and pacing typical Hollywood war-movie stuff , while the performances elicit more of a sense of deja vu than awe .
109791 | 0.66667 | The film feels uncomfortably real , its language and locations bearing the unmistakable stamp of authority .
109792 | 0.75 | The film fits into a genre that has been overexposed , redolent of a thousand cliches , and yet remains uniquely itself , vibrant with originality .
109793 | 0.41667 | The film has a childlike quality about it .
109803 | 0.76389 | The film has the high-buffed gloss and high-octane jolts you expect of De Palma , but what makes it transporting is that it 's also one of the smartest , most pleasurable expressions of pure movie love to come from an American director in years .
109804 | 0.77778 | The film is ... determined to treat its characters , weak and strong , as fallible human beings , not caricatures , and to carefully delineate the cost of the inevitable conflicts between human urges and an institution concerned with self-preservation .
109805 | 0.59722 | The film is a blunt indictment , part of a perhaps surreal campaign to bring Kissinger to trial for crimes against humanity .
109811 | 0.70833 | The film is delicately narrated by Martin Landau and directed with sensitivity and skill by Dana Janklowicz-Mann .
109813 | 0.77778 | The film is hard to dismiss -- moody , thoughtful , and lit by flashes of mordant humor .
109814 | 0.84722 | The film is small in scope , yet perfectly formed .
109816 | 0.22222 | The film itself is about something very interesting and odd that would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative .
109821 | 0.41667 | The film makes strong arguments regarding the social status of America 's indigenous people , but really only exists to try to eke out an emotional tug of the heart , one which it fails to get .
109826 | 0.56944 | The film may not hit as hard as some of the better drug-related pictures , but it still manages to get a few punches in .
109831 | 0.66667 | The film occasionally tries the viewer 's patience with slow pacing and a main character who sometimes defies sympathy , but it ultimately satisfies with its moving story .
109832 | 0.77778 | The film oozes craft .
109837 | 0.58333 | The film sometimes flags ... but there is enough secondary action to keep things moving along at a brisk , amusing pace .
109842 | 0.25 | The film starts promisingly , but the ending is all too predictable and far too cliched to really work .
109843 | 0.41667 | The film thrusts the inchoate but already eldritch Christian Right propaganda machine into national media circles .
109846 | 0.33333 | The film ultimately offers nothing more than people in an urban jungle needing other people to survive ...
109847 | 0.93056 | The film was immensely enjoyable thanks to great performances by both Steve Buscemi and Rosario Dawson ...
109852 | 0.44444 | The film was n't preachy , but it was feminism by the book .
109853 | 0.59722 | The film will appeal to Discovery Channel fans and will surely widen the perspective of those of us who see the continent through rose-colored glasses .
109859 | 0.29167 | The film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based ` drama , ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves Blue Crush waterlogged .
109860 | 0.40278 | The filmmakers lack the nerve ... to fully exploit the script 's potential for sick humor .
109861 | 0.48611 | The filmmakers might want to look it up .
109867 | 0.68056 | The footage of the rappers at play and the prison interview with Suge Knight are just two of the elements that will grab you .
109869 | 0.69444 | The formula is familiar but enjoyable .
109877 | 0.38889 | The gags , and the script , are a mixed bag .
109879 | 0.84722 | The gags that fly at such a furiously funny pace that the only rip off that we were aware of was the one we felt when the movie ended so damned soon .
109882 | 0.33333 | The hackneyed story about an affluent damsel in distress who decides to fight her bully of a husband is simply too overdone .
109887 | 0.63889 | The hook is the drama within the drama , as an unsolved murder and an unresolved moral conflict jockey for the spotlight .
109889 | 0.69444 | The hypnotic imagery and fragmentary tale explore the connections between place and personal identity .
109891 | 0.5 | The images are usually abbreviated in favor of mushy obviousness and telegraphed pathos , particularly where Whitaker 's misfit artist is concerned .
109894 | 0.875 | The increasingly diverse French director has created a film that one can honestly describe as looking , sounding and simply feeling like no other film in recent history .
109901 | 0.45833 | The inevitable double - and triple-crosses arise , but the only drama is in waiting to hear how John Malkovich 's reedy consigliere will pronounce his next line .
109904 | 0.22222 | The inherent limitations of using a video game as the source material movie are once again made all too clear in this schlocky horror\/action hybrid .
109907 | 0.54167 | The innocence of holiday cheer ai n't what it used to be .
109910 | 0.48611 | The isolated moments of creative insanity finally are lost in the thin soup of canned humor .
109918 | 0.16667 | The jokes are flat , and the action looks fake .
109919 | 0.75 | The journey is worth your time , especially if you have Ellen Pompeo sitting next to you for the ride .
109921 | 0.61111 | The kind of primal storytelling that George Lucas can only dream of .
109923 | 0.5 | The kind of sense of humor that derives from a workman 's grasp of pun and entendre and its attendant need to constantly draw attention to itself .
109937 | 0.80556 | The lively appeal of The Last Kiss lies in the ease with which it integrates thoughtfulness and pasta-fagioli comedy .
109939 | 0.61111 | The locations go from stark desert to gorgeous beaches .
109945 | 0.27778 | The main story ... is compelling enough , but it 's difficult to shrug off the annoyance of that chatty fish .
109948 | 0.34722 | The makers of Mothman Prophecies succeed in producing that most frightening of all movies -- a mediocre horror film too bad to be good and too good to be bad .
109951 | 0.47222 | The messy emotions raging throughout this three-hour effort are instantly recognizable , allowing the film to paradoxically feel familiar and foreign at the same time .
109954 | 0.125 | The misery of these people becomes just another voyeuristic spectacle , to be consumed and forgotten .
109957 | 0.91667 | The modern master of the chase sequence returns with a chase to end all chases
109963 | 0.76389 | The more you think about the movie , the more you will probably like it .
109966 | 0.58333 | The most anti-human big studio picture since 3000 Miles to Graceland .
109969 | 0.66667 | The most audacious , outrageous , sexually explicit , psychologically probing , pure libido film of the year has arrived from Portugal .
109972 | 0.77778 | The most consistently funny of the Austin Powers films .
109975 | 0.97222 | The most ingenious film comedy since Being John Malkovich .
109978 | 0.18056 | The most offensive thing about the movie is that Hollywood expects people to pay to see it .
109981 | 0.31944 | The most opaque , self-indulgent and just plain goofy an excuse for a movie as you can imagine .
109983 | 0.86111 | The movie 's captivating details are all in the performances , from Foreman 's barking-mad Taylor to Thewlis 's smoothly sinister Freddie and Bettany\/McDowell 's hard-eyed gangster .
109986 | 0.34722 | The movie , like Bartleby , is something of a stiff -- an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes .
109987 | 0.47222 | The movie , while beautiful , feels labored , with a hint of the writing exercise about it .
109992 | 0.25 | The movie attempts to mine laughs from a genre -- the gangster\/crime comedy -- that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago , and its cutesy reliance on movie-specific cliches is n't exactly endearing .
109993 | 0.34722 | The movie is a mess from start to finish .
109994 | 0.27778 | The movie is as padded as Allen 's jelly belly .
109999 | 0.59722 | The movie is gorgeously made , but it is also somewhat shallow and art-conscious .
110004 | 0.375 | The movie is loaded with good intentions , but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the Holocaust escape story , Minac drains his movie of all individuality .
110006 | 0.083333 | The movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it .
110007 | 0.63889 | The movie is so thoughtlessly assembled .
110008 | 0.23611 | The movie keeps coming back to the achingly unfunny Phonce and his several silly subplots .
110009 | 0.30556 | The movie starts with a legend and ends with a story that is so far-fetched it would be impossible to believe if it were n't true .
110011 | 0.29167 | The movie weighs no more than a glass of flat champagne .
110016 | 0.47222 | The movie worked for me right up to the final scene , and then it caved in .
110024 | 0.86111 | The music makes a nice album , the food is enticing and Italy beckons us all .
110027 | 0.27778 | The mystery of Enigma is how a rich historical subject , combined with so much first-rate talent ... could have yielded such a flat , plodding picture .
110032 | 0.38889 | The new film of Anton Chekhov 's The Cherry Orchard puts the ` ick ' in ` classic . '
110042 | 0.083333 | The notion of deleting emotion from people , even in an advanced Prozac Nation , is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed Equilibrium becomes a concept doofus .
110045 | 0.38889 | The one not-so-small problem with Expecting is that the entire exercise has no real point .
110050 | 0.375 | The only surprise is that heavyweights Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis agreed to produce this ; I assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies ' underwear .
110053 | 0.30556 | The only thing I laughed at were the people who paid to see it .
110055 | 0.15278 | The only thing that distinguishes a Randall Wallace film from any other is the fact that there is nothing distinguishing in a Randall Wallace film .
110058 | 0.51389 | The only time 8 Crazy Nights comes close to hitting a comedic or satirical target is during the offbeat musical numbers .
110062 | 0.29167 | The overall vibe is druggy and self-indulgent , like a spring-break orgy for pretentious arts majors .
110065 | 0.25 | The package in which this fascinating -- and timely -- content comes wrapped is disappointingly generic .
110067 | 0.44444 | The party scenes deliver some tawdry kicks .
110070 | 0.86111 | The performances are an absolute joy .
110071 | 0.875 | The performances are immaculate , with Roussillon providing comic relief .
110072 | 0.68056 | The performances are strong , though the subject matter demands acting that borders on hammy at times .
110080 | 0.41667 | The philosophical musings of the dialogue jar against the tawdry soap opera antics of the film 's action in a way that is surprisingly enjoyable .
110085 | 0.66667 | The picture 's fascinating byways are littered with trenchant satirical jabs at the peculiar egocentricities of the acting breed .
110090 | 0.20833 | The plot grows thin soon , and you find yourself praying for a quick resolution .
110091 | 0.44444 | The plot plummets into a comedy graveyard before Janice comes racing to the rescue in the final reel .
110095 | 0.68056 | The powder blues and sun-splashed whites of Tunis make an alluring backdrop for this sensuous and spirited tale of a prim widow who finds an unlikely release in belly-dancing clubs .
110097 | 0.43056 | The problem is not that it 's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes .
110099 | 0.25 | The problem is that Van Wilder does little that is actually funny with the material .
110100 | 0.18056 | The problem is that it is one that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another .
110103 | 0.097222 | The problem with ANTWONE FISHER is that it has a screenplay written by Antwone Fisher based on the book by Antwone Fisher .
110110 | 0.83333 | The problems and characters it reveals are universal and involving , and the film itself -- as well its delightful cast -- is so breezy , pretty and gifted , it really won my heart .
110112 | 0.63889 | The production values are of the highest and the performances attractive without being memorable .
110115 | 0.73611 | The rare Imax movie that you 'll wish was longer than an hour .
110117 | 0.26389 | The re - enactments , however fascinating they may be as history , are too crude to serve the work especially well .
110124 | 0.75 | The real star of this movie is the score , as in the songs translate well to film , and it 's really well directed .
110127 | 0.5 | The respective charms of Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant have worn threadbare .
110134 | 0.18056 | The result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today 's Hollywood .
110135 | 0.84722 | The result is a powerful , naturally dramatic piece of low-budget filmmaking .
110136 | 0.5 | The result might look like Vulgar .
110137 | 0.31944 | The results are far more alienating than involving .
110144 | 0.41667 | The script 's snazzy dialogue establishes a realistic atmosphere that involves us in the unfolding crisis , but the lazy plotting ensures that little of our emotional investment pays off .
110145 | 0.33333 | The script becomes lifeless and falls apart like a cheap lawn chair .
110148 | 0.26389 | The script covers huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that does n't offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people .
110149 | 0.125 | The script falls back on too many tried-and-true shenanigans that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy .
110150 | 0.66667 | The script is high on squaddie banter , low on shocks .
110152 | 0.375 | The sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give Blade fans another look at Wesley Snipes ' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once .
110155 | 0.34722 | The setting turns out to be more interesting than any of the character dramas , which never reach satisfying conclusions .
110161 | 0.79167 | The sheer joy and pride they took in their work -- and in each other -- shines through every frame .
110164 | 0.33333 | The skirmishes for power waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense .
110166 | 0.875 | The slam-bang superheroics are kinetic enough to engross even the most antsy youngsters .
110170 | 0.83333 | The soundtrack alone is worth the price of admission .
110171 | 0.875 | The story gives ample opportunity for large-scale action and suspense , which director Shekhar Kapur supplies with tremendous skill .
110172 | 0.31944 | The story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than I 'd care to count .
110173 | 0.79167 | The story is smart and entirely charming in intent and execution .
110175 | 0.47222 | The story is so light and sugary that were it a Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade balloon , extra heavy-duty ropes would be needed to keep it from floating away .
110180 | 0.47222 | The story is virtually impossible to follow here , but there 's a certain style and wit to the dialogue .
110183 | 0.88889 | The story itself it mostly told through on-camera interviews with several survivors , whose riveting memories are rendered with such clarity that it 's as if it all happened only yesterday .
110186 | 0.13889 | The story suffers a severe case of oversimplification , superficiality and silliness .
110188 | 0.76389 | The story that emerges has elements of romance , tragedy and even silent-movie comedy .
110191 | 0.84722 | The strength of the film comes not from any cinematic razzle-dazzle but from its recovery of an historical episode that , in the simple telling , proves simultaneously harrowing and uplifting .
110192 | 0.61111 | The strength of the film lies in its two central performances by Sven Wollter as the stricken composer and Viveka Seldahl as his desperate violinist wife .
110194 | 0.5 | The symbols float like butterflies and the spinning styx sting like bees .
110197 | 0.41667 | The talk-heavy film plays like one of Robert Altman 's lesser works .
110205 | 0.125 | The thing just never gets off the ground .
110208 | 0.26389 | The things this movie tries to get the audience to buy just wo n't fly with most intelligent viewers .
110214 | 0.26389 | The town has kind of an authentic feel , but each one of these people stand out and everybody else is in the background and it just seems manufactured to me and artificial .
110217 | 0.20833 | The trappings of I Spy are so familiar you might as well be watching a rerun .
110220 | 0.29167 | The trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness .
110222 | 0.56944 | The umpteenth summer skinny dip in Jerry Bruckheimer 's putrid pond of retread action twaddle .
110228 | 0.72222 | The underworld urban angst is derivative of Martin Scorsese 's Taxi Driver and Goodfellas , but this film speaks for itself .
110241 | 0.84722 | The unique niche of self-critical , behind-the-scenes navel-gazing Kaufman has carved from Orleans ' story and his own infinite insecurity is a work of outstanding originality .
110243 | 0.43056 | The video work is so grainy and rough , so dependent on being ` naturalistic ' rather than carefully lit and set up , that it 's exhausting to watch .
110246 | 0.59722 | The warnings to resist temptation in this film ... are blunt and challenging and offer no easy rewards for staying clean .
110248 | 0.083333 | The waterlogged script plumbs uncharted depths of stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric sexual banter .
110251 | 0.27778 | The weird thing about The Santa Clause 2 , purportedly a children 's movie , is that there is nothing in it to engage children emotionally .
110253 | 0.45833 | The whole affair is as predictable as can be .
110260 | 0.58333 | The wonderful combination of the sweetness and the extraordinary technical accomplishments of the first film are maintained , but its overall impact falls a little flat with a storyline that never quite delivers the original magic .

110286 | 0.41667 | There 's a lot of good material here , but there 's also a lot of redundancy and unsuccessful crudeness accompanying it .
110287 | 0.66667 | There 's a lot of tooth in Roger Dodger .
110292 | 0.38889 | There 's a reason why halftime is only fifteen minutes long .
110293 | 0.77778 | There 's a sheer unbridled delight in the way the story unfurls ...
110294 | 0.63889 | There 's absolutely no reason why Blue Crush , a late-summer surfer girl entry , should be as entertaining as it is
110299 | 0.29167 | There 's an excellent 90-minute film here ; unfortunately , it runs for 170 .
110300 | 0.33333 | There 's more repetition than creativity throughout the movie .
110304 | 0.69444 | There 's much tongue in cheek in the film and there 's no doubt the filmmaker is having fun with it all .
110305 | 0.83333 | There 's no denying that Burns is a filmmaker with a bright future ahead of him .
110310 | 0.51389 | There 's no doubting that this is a highly ambitious and personal project for Egoyan , but it 's also one that , next to his best work , feels clumsy and convoluted .
110311 | 0.43056 | There 's no getting around the fact that this is Revenge Of The Nerds Revisited -- again .
110312 | 0.33333 | There 's no good answer to that one .
110313 | 0.34722 | There 's no point in extracting the bare bones of Byatt 's plot for purposes of bland Hollywood romance .
110318 | 0.33333 | There 's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of Joan 's prefeminist plight , so we 're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity .

110335 | 0.625 | There 's something to be said for a studio-produced film that never bothers to hand viewers a suitcase full of easy answers .
110336 | 0.22222 | There 's something unintentionally comic in the film 's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties .
110337 | 0.27778 | There 's the plot , and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream .
110342 | 0.625 | There 's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there 's nothing else happening .
110343 | 0.66667 | There are enough throwaway references to faith and rainbows to plant smile-button faces on that segment of the populace that made A Walk to Remember a niche hit .

110350 | 0.59722 | There are problems with this film that even 3 Oscar winners ca n't overcome , but it 's a nice girl-buddy movie once it gets rock-n-rolling .
110351 | 0.65278 | There are so few films about the plight of American Indians in modern America that Skins comes as a welcome , if downbeat , missive from a forgotten front .
110356 | 0.33333 | There are some fairly unsettling scenes , but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer .

110376 | 0.54167 | There is one surefire way to get a nomination for a best-foreign-film Oscar : Make a movie about whimsical folk who learn a nonchallenging , life-affirming lesson while walking around a foreign city with stunning architecture .
110377 | 0.80556 | There is simply no doubt that this film asks the right questions at the right time in the history of our country .
110378 | 0.41667 | There is so much plodding sensitivity .
110379 | 0.76389 | There is something that is so meditative and lyrical about Babak Payami 's boldly quirky Iranian drama Secret Ballot ... a charming and evoking little ditty that manages to show the gentle and humane side of Middle Eastern world politics

110414 | 0.22222 | This 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material .
110417 | 0.22222 | This 10th film in the series looks and feels tired .
110419 | 0.88889 | This Chicago has hugely imaginative and successful casting to its great credit , as well as one terrific score and attitude to spare .
110428 | 0.65278 | This amiable picture talks tough , but it 's all bluster -- in the end it 's as sweet as Greenfingers ...
110430 | 0.23611 | This cloying , voices-from-the-other-side story is hell .
110435 | 0.33333 | This dreadfully earnest inversion of the Concubine love triangle eschews the previous film 's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension .
110438 | 0.81944 | This fascinating look at Israel in ferment feels as immediate as the latest news footage from Gaza and , because of its heightened , well-shaped dramas , twice as powerful .
110442 | 0.77778 | This film is an act of spiritual faith -- an eloquent , deeply felt meditation on the nature of compassion .
110445 | 0.13889 | This flat run at a hip-hop Tootsie is so poorly paced you could fit all of Pootie Tang in between its punchlines .
110447 | 0.59722 | This follow-up seems so similar to the 1953 Disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric Peter .
110449 | 0.83333 | This gorgeous epic is guaranteed to lift the spirits of the whole family .
110452 | 0.59722 | This harrowing journey into combat hell vividly captures the chaotic insanity and personal tragedies that are all too abundant when human hatred spews forth unchecked .
110455 | 0.5 | This heist flick about young Brooklyn hoods is off the shelf after two years to capitalize on the popularity of Vin Diesel , Seth Green and Barry Pepper .
110461 | 0.66667 | This humbling little film , fueled by the light comedic work of Zhao Benshan and the delicate ways of Dong Jie , is just the sort for those moviegoers who complain that ` they do n't make movies like they used to anymore . '
110462 | 0.66667 | This is a dark , gritty , sometimes funny little gem .
110463 | 0.91667 | This is a fascinating film because there is no clear-cut hero and no all-out villain .
110464 | 0.30556 | This is a film living far too much in its own head .
110465 | 0.055556 | This is a fudged opportunity of gigantic proportions -- a lunar mission with no signs of life .
110474 | 0.86111 | This is a movie full of grace and , ultimately , hope .
110475 | 0.375 | This is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action .
110480 | 0.95833 | This is a movie that refreshes the mind and spirit along with the body , so original is its content , look , and style .
110485 | 0.59722 | This is a nervy , risky film , and Villeneuve has inspired Croze to give herself over completely to the tormented persona of Bibi .
110486 | 0.27778 | This is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which Wilson and Murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie .
110487 | 0.66667 | This is a shrewd and effective film from a director who understands how to create and sustain a mood .
110492 | 0.76389 | This is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker , but good actors , good poetry and good music help sustain it .
110493 | 0.54167 | This is amusing for about three minutes .
110494 | 0.91667 | This is an elegantly balanced movie -- every member of the ensemble has something fascinating to do -- that does n't reveal even a hint of artifice .
110496 | 0.041667 | This is an ungainly movie , ill-fitting , with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be .
110500 | 0.77778 | This is one of those rare docs that paints a grand picture of an era and makes the journey feel like a party .
110505 | 0.86111 | This is one of those war movies that focuses on human interaction rather than battle and action sequences ... and it 's all the stronger because of it .
110510 | 0.875 | This is the best Star Trek movie in a long time .
110511 | 0.055556 | This is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness .
110512 | 0.013889 | This is the sort of low-grade dreck that usually goes straight to video -- with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography , complete with visible boom mikes .
110513 | 0.68056 | This is the stuff that Disney movies are made of .
110516 | 0.73611 | This kind of hands-on storytelling is ultimately what makes Shanghai Ghetto move beyond a good , dry , reliable textbook and what allows it to rank with its worthy predecessors .
110521 | 0.027778 | This mess of a movie is nothing short of a travesty of a transvestite comedy .
110531 | 0.36111 | This misty-eyed Southern nostalgia piece , in treading the line between sappy and sanguine , winds up mired in tear-drenched quicksand .
110532 | 0.22222 | This movie ... does n't deserve the energy it takes to describe how bad it is .
110536 | 0.84722 | This often-hilarious farce manages to generate the belly laughs of lowbrow comedy without sacrificing its high-minded appeal .
110540 | 0.84722 | This quiet , introspective and entertaining independent is worth seeking .
110545 | 0.20833 | This remake of Lina Wertmuller 's 1975 eroti-comedy might just be the biggest husband-and-wife disaster since John and Bo Derek made the ridiculous Bolero .
110550 | 0.79167 | This rich , bittersweet Israeli documentary , about the life of song-and-dance-man Pasach ` ke Burstein and his family , transcends ethnic lines .
110554 | 0.40278 | This slow-moving Swedish film offers not even a hint of joy , preferring to focus on the humiliation of Martin as he defecates in bed and urinates on the plants at his own birthday party .
110556 | 0.72222 | This submarine drama earns the right to be favorably compared to Das Boot .
110561 | 0.29167 | This tale has been told and retold ; the races and rackets change , but the song remains the same .
110563 | 0.13889 | This thing is just garbage .
110569 | 0.31944 | This wretchedly unfunny wannabe comedy is inane and awful - no doubt , it 's the worst movie I 've seen this summer .
110576 | 0.375 | Thoroughly engrossing and ultimately tragic .
110583 | 0.11111 | Those of you who are not an eighth grade girl will most likely doze off during this one .
110590 | 0.66667 | Those who do n't entirely ` get ' Godard 's distinctive discourse will still come away with a sense of his reserved but existential poignancy .
110593 | 0.69444 | Though Nijinsky 's words grow increasingly disturbed , the film maintains a beguiling serenity and poise that make it accessible for a non-narrative feature .
110595 | 0.30556 | Though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled , others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere .
110597 | 0.83333 | Though in some ways similar to Catherine Breillat 's Fat Girl , Rain is the far superior film .
110599 | 0.55556 | Though it flirts with bathos and pathos and the further Oprahfication of the world as we know it , it still cuts all the way down to broken bone .
110601 | 0.44444 | Though its atmosphere is intriguing ... the drama is finally too predictable to leave much of an impression .
110603 | 0.76389 | Though its story is only surface deep , the visuals and enveloping sounds of Blue Crush make this surprisingly decent flick worth a summertime look-see .
110605 | 0.75 | Though overall an overwhelmingly positive portrayal , the film does n't ignore the more problematic aspects of Brown 's life .
110607 | 0.66667 | Though the aboriginal aspect lends the ending an extraordinary poignancy , and the story itself could be played out in any working class community in the nation .
110609 | 0.68056 | Though the film is well-intentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable .
110611 | 0.45833 | Though the film never veers from its comic course , its unintentional parallels might inadvertently evoke memories and emotions which are anything but humorous .
110613 | 0.40278 | Though the opera itself takes place mostly indoors , Jacquot seems unsure of how to evoke any sort of naturalism on the set .
110615 | 0.29167 | Though this rude and crude film does deliver a few gut-busting laughs , its digs at modern society are all things we 've seen before .
110617 | 0.63889 | Though this saga would be terrific to read about , it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch .
110621 | 0.38889 | Throw Smoochy from the train !
110624 | 0.80556 | Throws in enough clever and unexpected twists to make the formula feel fresh .
110639 | 0.27778 | Time Out is as serious as a pink slip .
110646 | 0.16667 | Tiresomely derivative and hammily acted .
110658 | 0.19444 | To better understand why this did n't connect with me would require another viewing , and I wo n't be sitting through this one again ... that in itself is commentary enough .
110660 | 0.16667 | To build a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-madman is off-putting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved .
110666 | 0.875 | To call this one an eventual cult classic would be an understatement , and woe is the horror fan who opts to overlook this goofily endearing and well-lensed gorefest .
110669 | 0.11111 | To paraphrase a line from another Dickens ' novel , Nicholas Nickleby is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato .
110672 | 0.40278 | To show these characters in the act and give them no feelings of remorse -- and to cut repeatedly to the flashback of the original rape -- is overkill to the highest degree .
110678 | 0.63889 | To those who have not read the book , the film is a much better mother-daughter tale than last summer 's ` Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood , ' but that 's not saying much .
110702 | 0.22222 | Too bad Maggio could n't come up with a better script .
110706 | 0.27778 | Too campy to work as straight drama and too violent and sordid to function as comedy , Vulgar is , truly and thankfully , a one-of-a-kind work .
110708 | 0.65278 | Too clever by about nine-tenths .
110711 | 0.29167 | Too much of Nemesis has a tired , talky feel .
110713 | 0.30556 | Too much of Storytelling moves away from Solondz 's social critique , casting its audience as that of intellectual lector in contemplation of the auteur 's professional injuries .
110717 | 0.22222 | Too silly to take seriously .
110719 | 0.22222 | Too slow for a younger crowd , too shallow for an older one .
110721 | 0.34722 | Too smart to ignore but a little too smugly superior to like , this could be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot .
110738 | 0.75 | Touches smartly and wistfully on a number of themes , not least the notion that the marginal members of society ... might benefit from a helping hand and a friendly kick in the pants .
110740 | 0.31944 | Toward the end Sum of All Fears morphs into a mundane '70s disaster flick .
110745 | 0.43056 | Trailer park Magnolia : too long , too cutesy , too sure of its own importance , and possessed of that peculiar tension of being too dense & about nothing at all .
110754 | 0.13889 | Tries to work in the same vein as the brilliance of Animal House but instead comes closer to the failure of the third Revenge of the Nerds sequel .
110765 | 0.88889 | Try as you might to scrutinize the ethics of Kaufman 's approach , somehow it all comes together to create a very compelling , sensitive , intelligent and almost cohesive piece of film entertainment .
110771 | 0.34722 | Trying to make head or tail of the story in the hip-hop indie Snipes is enough to give you brain strain -- and the pay-off is negligible .
110775 | 0.70833 | Tsai Ming-liang 's witty , wistful new film , What Time Is It There ?
110778 | 0.44444 | Tsai has managed to create an underplayed melodrama about family dynamics and dysfunction that harks back to the spare , unchecked heartache of Yasujiro Ozu .
110780 | 0.83333 | Tully is worth a look for its true-to-life characters , its sensitive acting , its unadorned view of rural life and the subtle direction of first-timer Hilary Birmingham .
110784 | 0.95833 | Tunney , brimming with coltish , neurotic energy , holds the screen like a true star .
110800 | 0.73611 | Twohy 's a good yarn-spinner , and ultimately the story compels .
110801 | 0.72222 | Twohy knows how to inflate the mundane into the scarifying , and gets full mileage out of the rolling of a stray barrel or the unexpected blast of a phonograph record .
110806 | 0.61111 | UB equally spoofs and celebrates the more outre aspects of ` black culture ' and the dorkier aspects of ` white culture , ' even as it points out how inseparable the two are .
110809 | 0.29167 | Ultimately ... the movie is too heady for children , and too preachy for adults .
110810 | 0.5 | Ultimately feels like just one more in the long line of films this year about the business of making movies .
110818 | 0.45833 | Underachieves only in not taking the Shakespeare parallels quite far enough .
110822 | 0.25 | Unfortunately , Carvey 's rubber-face routine is no match for the insipid script he has crafted with Harris Goldberg .
110825 | 0.31944 | Unfortunately , there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them , either .
110826 | 0.38889 | Unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script .
110828 | 0.51389 | Unintelligible , poorly acted , brain-slappingly bad , Harvard Man is ludicrous enough that it could become a cult classic .
110834 | 0.29167 | Unsurprisingly , the way this all works out makes the women look more like stereotypical caretakers and moral teachers , instead of serious athletes .
110839 | 0.75 | Uplifting , funny and wise .
110843 | 0.61111 | Upsetting and thought-provoking , the film has an odd purity that does n't bring you into the characters so much as it has you study them .
110863 | 0.31944 | Ver Wiel 's desperate attempt at wit is lost , leaving the character of Critical Jim two-dimensional and pointless .
110869 | 0.69444 | Very amusing , not the usual route in a thriller , and the performances are odd and pixilated and sometimes both .
110871 | 0.625 | Very predictable but still entertaining
110874 | 0.40278 | Veterans of the dating wars will smirk uneasily at the film 's nightmare versions of everyday sex-in-the-city misadventures .
110877 | 0.52778 | Viewed as a comedy , a romance , a fairy tale , or a drama , there 's nothing remotely triumphant about this motion picture .
110879 | 0.375 | Viewers are asked so often to suspend belief that were it not for Holm 's performance , the film would be a total washout .
110881 | 0.38889 | Viewers of Barney 's crushingly self-indulgent spectacle will see nothing in it to match the ordeal of sitting through it .
110895 | 0.875 | Visually breathtaking , viscerally exciting , and dramatically moving , it 's the very definition of epic adventure .
110909 | 0.44444 | Wait for it to hit cable .
110911 | 0.75 | Waiting for Godard can be fruitful : ` In Praise of Love ' is the director 's epitaph for himself .
110919 | 0.43056 | Walsh ca n't quite negotiate the many inconsistencies in Janice 's behavior or compensate for them by sheer force of charm .
110936 | 0.68056 | Washington overcomes the script 's flaws and envelops the audience in his character 's anguish , anger and frustration .
110937 | 0.63889 | Watching Austin Powers in Goldmember is like binging on cotton candy .
110951 | 0.43056 | Watching Harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , but Boyd 's film offers little else of consequence .
110954 | 0.27778 | Watching Queen of the Damned is like reading a research paper , with special effects tossed in .
110956 | 0.58333 | Watching Spirited Away is like watching an Eastern imagination explode .
110958 | 0.61111 | Watching The Powerpuff Girls Movie , my mind kept returning to one anecdote for comparison : the cartoon in Japan that gave people seizures .
110968 | 0.125 | We 've liked Klein 's other work but Rollerball left us cold .
110974 | 0.097222 | We never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they 'll wind up together , and Michele 's spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest .
110983 | 0.625 | Weighty and ponderous but every bit as filling as the treat of the title .
110985 | 0.23611 | Weirdly , Broomfield has compelling new material but he does n't unveil it until the end , after endless scenes of him wheedling reluctant witnesses and pointing his camera through the smeared windshield of his rental car .
110994 | 0.19444 | Wendigo wants to be a monster movie for the art-house crowd , but it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time .
110998 | 0.56944 | Were it not for a sentimental resolution that explains way more about Cal than does the movie or the character any good , Freundlich 's World Traveler might have been one of the more daring and surprising American movies of the year .
111013 | 0.68056 | What 's most memorable about Circuit is that it 's shot on digital video , whose tiny camera enables Shafer to navigate spaces both large ... and small ... with considerable aplomb .
111015 | 0.73611 | What 's so striking about Jolie 's performance is that she never lets her character become a caricature -- not even with that radioactive hair .
111016 | 0.68056 | What 's surprising about this traditional thriller , moderately successful but not completely satisfying , is exactly how genteel and unsurprising the execution turns out to be .
111020 | 0.69444 | What a dumb , fun , curiously adolescent movie this is .
111021 | 0.72222 | What begins as a conventional thriller evolves into a gorgeously atmospheric meditation on life-changing chance encounters .
111022 | 0.51389 | What begins as a film in the tradition of The Graduate quickly switches into something more recyclable than significant .
111024 | 0.625 | What emerges is an unsettling picture of childhood innocence combined with indoctrinated prejudice .
111027 | 0.61111 | What lifts the film high above run-of-the-filth gangster flicks is its refusal to recognise any of the signposts , as if discovering a way through to the bitter end without a map .
111033 | 0.86111 | What makes Salton Sea surprisingly engrossing is that Caruso takes an atypically hypnotic approach to a world that 's often handled in fast-edit , hopped-up fashion .

144791 | 0.27778 | Despite a powerful portrayal by Binoche , it 's a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum .
144793 | 0.20833 | Despite all evidence to the contrary , this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie , the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on TV and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults .

144805 | 0.45833 | Despite its good nature and some genuinely funny moments , Super Troopers suffers from a bad case of arrested development .
144806 | 0.44444 | Despite its title , Amy 's Orgasm is not a porno , though it is as tedious as one .

146334 | 0 | Instead of hiding Pinocchio from critics , Miramax should have hidden it from everyone .
146338 | 0.097222 | Instead of making his own style , director Marcus Adams just copies from various sources -- good sources , bad mixture
146340 | 0.29167 | Instead of panoramic sweep , Kapur gives us episodic choppiness , undermining the story 's emotional thrust .
146343 | 0.26389 | Intended to be a comedy about relationships , this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area .
146348 | 0.72222 | Intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story 's least interesting subject .
146356 | 0.11111 | Involves two mysteries -- one it gives away and the other featuring such badly drawn characters that its outcome hardly matters .
146359 | 0.30556 | Involving at times , but lapses quite casually into the absurd .
146367 | 0.38889 | Irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater .

146388 | 0.19444 | It 's Splash without the jokes .
146390 | 0.44444 | It 's Young Guns meets Goodfellas in this easily skippable hayseeds-vs .
146392 | 0.44444 | It 's a 100-year old mystery that is constantly being interrupted by Elizabeth Hurley in a bathing suit .
146393 | 0.31944 | It 's a bad sign in a thriller when you instantly know whodunit .
146394 | 0.16667 | It 's a bad thing when a movie has about as much substance as its end credits blooper reel .
146395 | 0.44444 | It 's a bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script , unimpressive acting and indifferent direction .
146399 | 0.44444 | It 's a boom-box of a movie that might have been titled ` The Loud and the Ludicrous ' ... the pandering to a moviegoing audience dominated by young males is all too calculated .
146400 | 0.31944 | It 's a buggy drag .
146401 | 0.33333 | It 's a cookie-cutter movie , a cut-and-paste job .
146406 | 0.63889 | It 's a decent glimpse into a time period , and an outcast , that is no longer accessible , but it does n't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor .
146407 | 0.41667 | It 's a deeply serious movie that cares passionately about its subject , but too often becomes ponderous in its teaching of history , or lost in the intricate connections and multiple timelines of its story .
146413 | 0.27778 | It 's a film that hinges on its casting , and Glover really does n't fit the part .
146414 | 0.34722 | It 's a film with an idea buried somewhere inside its fabric , but never clearly seen or felt .
146415 | 0.40278 | It 's a flashy , star-splashed reduction .
146416 | 0.22222 | It 's a grab bag of genres that do n't add up to a whole lot of sense .
146422 | 0.069444 | It 's a loathsome movie , it really is and it makes absolutely no sense .
146423 | 0.30556 | It 's a movie forged in the fires of Chick Flick Hell .
146424 | 0.31944 | It 's a pedestrian , flat drama that screams out ` amateur ' in almost every frame .
146425 | 0.40278 | It 's a sometimes interesting remake that does n't compare to the brilliant original .
146426 | 0.54167 | It 's a trifle .
146427 | 0.44444 | It 's a trifle of a movie , with a few laughs surrounding an unremarkable soft center .
146432 | 0.63889 | It 's a very sincere work , but it would be better as a diary or documentary .
146434 | 0.44444 | It 's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition .
146436 | 0.34722 | It 's all pretty cynical and condescending , too .
146437 | 0.63889 | It 's all very cute , though not terribly funny if you 're more than six years old .
146442 | 0.51389 | It 's also clear from the start that The Transporter is running purely on adrenaline , and once the initial high wears off , the film 's shortcomings start to shine through .
146443 | 0.25 | It 's also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views .
146445 | 0.19444 | It 's an awfully derivative story .
146446 | 0.45833 | It 's an earnest debut full of heartfelt performances , but is ultimately let down by a story that is all too predictable .
146447 | 0.20833 | It 's another stale , kill-by-numbers flick , complete with blade-thin characters and terrible , pun-laden dialogue .
146448 | 0.27778 | It 's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that 's often written off as indie film naturalism .
146449 | 0.22222 | It 's as flat as an open can of pop left sitting in the sun .
146450 | 0.18056 | It 's as if De Palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up Kraft Macaroni and Cheese .
146451 | 0.11111 | It 's as if you 're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak , and it has been unearthed and released now , when it has become even weaker .
146452 | 0.15278 | It 's badly acted , blandly directed , and could have been scripted by someone who just graduated from elementary school .
146453 | 0.40278 | It 's basically an overlong episode of Tales from the Crypt .
146458 | 0.097222 | It 's been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since I last walked out on a movie , but Resident Evil really earned my indignant , preemptive departure .
146459 | 0.31944 | It 's best to avoid imprisonment with the dull , nerdy folks that inhabit Cherish .
146460 | 0.72222 | It 's better than The Phantom Menace .
146464 | 0.25 | It 's both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts to be poignant .
146467 | 0.22222 | It 's clear the filmmakers were n't sure where they wanted their story to go , and even more clear that they lack the skills to get us to this undetermined destination .
146468 | 0.13889 | It 's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here 's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role .
146472 | 0.041667 | It 's difficult to say whether The Tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing -- I 'm prepared to call it a draw .
146473 | 0.23611 | It 's disappointing when filmmakers throw a few big-name actors and cameos at a hokey script .
146478 | 0.18056 | It 's drained of life in an attempt to be sober and educational , and yet it 's so devoid of realism that its lack of whistles and bells just makes it obnoxious and stiff .
146483 | 0.16667 | It 's dumb , but more importantly , it 's just not scary .
146484 | 0.11111 | It 's everything you do n't go to the movies for .
146485 | 0.15278 | It 's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as The Country Bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at Disneyland .
146486 | 0.22222 | It 's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high .
146487 | 0.52778 | It 's fun , but a psychological mess , with Austin Powers bumping his head on the way out of the closet .
146493 | 0.48611 | It 's got its heart in the right place , but it also wilts after awhile .
146494 | 0.20833 | It 's hampered by a Lifetime-channel kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth .
146495 | 0.19444 | It 's hard not to feel you 've just watched a feature-length video game with some really heavy back story .
146496 | 0.26389 | It 's hard to believe these jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before .
146497 | 0.47222 | It 's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there 's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong .
146502 | 0.33333 | It 's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and Shiner , starring Michael Caine as an aging British boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that .
146506 | 0.26389 | It 's hard to tell with all the crashing and banging where the salesmanship ends and the movie begins .
146507 | 0.58333 | It 's harmless , diverting fluff .
146517 | 0.23611 | It 's inoffensive , cheerful , built to inspire the young people , set to an unending soundtrack of beach party pop numbers and aside from its remarkable camerawork and awesome scenery , it 's about as exciting as a sunburn .
146518 | 0.30556 | It 's just a silly black genre spoof .
146522 | 0.33333 | It 's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface .
146525 | 0.23611 | It 's just hard to believe that a life like this can sound so dull .
146526 | 0.097222 | It 's just incredibly dull .
146527 | 0.23611 | It 's just plain lurid when it is n't downright silly .
146533 | 0.31944 | It 's leaden and predictable , and laughs are lacking .
146538 | 0.26389 | It 's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert .
146539 | 0.40278 | It 's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes .
146544 | 0.23611 | It 's mildly amusing , but I certainly ca n't recommend it .
146545 | 0.18056 | It 's never a good sign when a film 's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma .
146551 | 0.375 | It 's not as awful as some of the recent Hollywood trip tripe ... but it 's far from a groundbreaking endeavor .
146553 | 0.18056 | It 's not horrible , just horribly mediocre .
146557 | 0.055556 | It 's not just the vampires that are damned in Queen of the Damned -- the viewers will feel they suffer the same fate .
146563 | 0.25 | It 's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it does n't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks .
146567 | 0.31944 | It 's not that Kung Pow is n't funny some of the time -- it just is n't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all Oedekerk 's impish augmentation .
146568 | 0.56944 | It 's not that Waiting For Happiness is a bad film , because it is n't .
146570 | 0.36111 | It 's not the ultimate Depression-era gangster movie .
146581 | 0.55556 | It 's not without its pleasures , but I 'll stick with The Tune .
146582 | 0.30556 | It 's of the quality of a lesser Harrison Ford movie - Six Days , Seven Nights , maybe , or that dreadful Sabrina remake .
146587 | 0.375 | It 's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold .
146589 | 0.20833 | It 's one long bore .
146597 | 0.75 | It 's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible .
146598 | 0.15278 | It 's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions .
146599 | 0.097222 | It 's painful .
146601 | 0.31944 | It 's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up .
146607 | 0.29167 | It 's push-the-limits teen comedy , the type written by people who ca n't come up with legitimate funny , and it 's used so extensively that good bits are hopelessly overshadowed .
146608 | 0.29167 | It 's really yet another anemic and formulaic Lethal Weapon-derived buddy-cop movie , trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness .
146615 | 0.13889 | It 's so badly made on every level that I 'm actually having a hard time believing people were paid to make it .
146616 | 0.20833 | It 's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it 's left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence .
146617 | 0.16667 | It 's so full of wrong choices that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief -- and worry about what classic Oliver Parker intends to mangle next time .
146618 | 0.34722 | It 's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just ca n't get no satisfaction .
146619 | 0.26389 | It 's so underwritten that you ca n't figure out just where the other characters , including Ana 's father and grandfather , come down on the issue of Ana 's future .
146621 | 0.43056 | It 's sweet , harmless , dumb , occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show .
146627 | 0.29167 | It 's the kind of movie you ca n't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you ca n't bring yourself to dislike it .
146629 | 0.18056 | It 's too interested in jerking off in all its Byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience .
146630 | 0.43056 | It 's too long , too repetitive , and takes way too many years to resolve to be a total winner .
146631 | 0.36111 | It 's too self-important and plodding to be funny , and too clipped and abbreviated to be an epic .
146635 | 0.55556 | It 's tough , astringent , darkly funny and ... well , it 's also generic , untidy , condescending and mild of impact rather than stunning .
146637 | 0.13889 | It all drags on so interminably it 's like watching a miserable relationship unfold in real time .
146638 | 0.19444 | It all feels like a Monty Python sketch gone horribly wrong .
146639 | 0.625 | It almost plays like Solaris , but with guns and jokes .
146640 | 0.30556 | It appears that something has been lost in the translation to the screen .
146643 | 0.29167 | It becomes gimmicky instead of compelling .
146647 | 0.41667 | It believes it 's revealing some great human truths , when , in reality , it 's churning ground that has long passed the point of being fertile .
146648 | 0.33333 | It ca n't decide if it wants to be a mystery\/thriller , a romance or a comedy .
146650 | 0.25 | It concentrates far too much on the awkward interplay and utter lack of chemistry between Chan and Hewitt .
146651 | 0.55556 | It conveys a simple message in a visual style that is willfully overwrought .
146652 | 0.33333 | It delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for Deeper Meaning .
146659 | 0.27778 | It does n't do the original any particular dishonor , but neither does it exude any charm or personality .
146660 | 0.13889 | It does n't help that the director and cinematographer Stephen Kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel .
146671 | 0.45833 | It does n't quite work , but there 's enough here to make us look forward to the Russos ' next offering .
146672 | 0.23611 | It does nothing new with the old story , except to show fisticuffs in this sort of stop-go slow motion that makes the gang rumbles look like they 're being streamed over a 28K modem .
146676 | 0.125 | It feels like a community theater production of a great Broadway play : Even at its best , it will never hold a candle to the original .
146681 | 0.13889 | It feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes .
146693 | 0.33333 | It gets the details of its time frame right but it completely misses its emotions .
146696 | 0.38889 | It has all the excitement of eating oatmeal .
146697 | 0.30556 | It has its moments of swaggering camaraderie , but more often just feels generic , derivative and done to death .
146698 | 0.44444 | It is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie ... but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made Eurotrash cult object .
146701 | 0.63889 | It is also , at times , curiously moving .
146702 | 0.29167 | It is just too bad the film 's story does not live up to its style .
146706 | 0.33333 | It is most of the things Costner movies are known for ; it 's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it .
146712 | 0.47222 | It kinda works and qualifies as cool at times , but is just too lame to work or be cool at others .
146718 | 0.38889 | It made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen .
146719 | 0.43056 | It makes sense that he went back to school to check out the girls -- his film is a frat boy 's idea of a good time .
146724 | 0.52778 | It may be a prize winner , but Teacher is a bomb .
146729 | 0.33333 | It may be an easy swipe to take , but this Barbershop just does n't make the cut .
146731 | 0.43056 | It might be the first sci-fi comedy that could benefit from a Three 's Company-style laugh track .
146732 | 0.31944 | It offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment .
146733 | 0.52778 | It plays like a big-budget , after-school special with a generous cast , who at times lift the material from its well-meaning clunkiness .
146735 | 0.47222 | It seems just a long , convoluted ploy to get men into drag -- period drag , no less .
146736 | 0.27778 | It settles for being merely grim .
146737 | 0.81944 | It should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit .
146741 | 0.22222 | It showcases Carvey 's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one 's patience to get to the good stuff .
146742 | 0.25 | It smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original .
146743 | 0.22222 | It sticks rigidly to the paradigm , rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived , well-worn situations .
146749 | 0.11111 | It takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as ` worse than expected , ' but Ghost Ship somehow manages to do exactly that .
146750 | 0.11111 | It takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of Robert Forster , Anne Meara , Eugene Levy , and Reginald VelJohnson all in the same movie .
146751 | 0.29167 | It takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived .
146752 | 0.5 | It tells more than it shows .
146753 | 0.19444 | It treats women like idiots .
146754 | 0.31944 | It tries too hard , and overreaches the logic of its own world .
146755 | 0.45833 | It uses the pain and violence of war as background material for color .
146756 | 0.30556 | It virtually defines a comedy that 's strongly mediocre , with funny bits surfacing every once in a while .
146761 | 0.5 | It wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy .
146762 | 0.29167 | It will come as no surprise that the movie is n't scary .
146772 | 0.43056 | It will probably prove interesting to Ram Dass fans , but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow , peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture .
146773 | 0.38889 | It wo n't be long before you 'll spy I Spy at a video store near you .
146774 | 0.041667 | It would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi .
146775 | 0.16667 | It would be hard to think of a recent movie that has worked this hard to achieve this little fun .
146776 | 0.45833 | It would have benefitted the dialogue .
146778 | 0.40278 | It would work much better as a one-hour TV documentary .
146780 | 0.25 | Its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper .
146788 | 0.20833 | Its lack of quality earns it a place alongside those other two recent Dumas botch-jobs , The Man in the Iron Mask and The Musketeer .
146791 | 0.20833 | Its over-reliance on genre conventions , character types and formulaic conflict resolutions crushes all the goodwill it otherwise develops .
146793 | 0.33333 | Its salient points are simultaneously buried , drowned and smothered in the excesses of writer-director Roger Avary .
146796 | 0.29167 | Its save-the-planet message clashes with its crass marketing .
146797 | 0.29167 | Its story may be a thousand years old , but why did it have to seem like it took another thousand to tell it to us ?
146806 | 0.44444 | Ja Rule and Kurupt should have gotten to rap .
146812 | 0.36111 | Jackson shamefully strolls through this mess with a smug grin , inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder .
146816 | 0.47222 | Jacquot 's rendering of Puccini 's tale of devotion and double-cross is more than just a filmed opera .
146820 | 0.26389 | Jaglom offers the none-too-original premise that everyone involved with moviemaking is a con artist and a liar .
146850 | 0.30556 | Jason X is positively anti-Darwinian : nine sequels and 400 years later , the teens are none the wiser and Jason still kills on auto-pilot .
146902 | 0.18056 | John Leguizamo may be a dramatic actor -- just not in this movie .
146917 | 0.5 | Johnson has , in his first film , set himself a task he is not nearly up to .
146920 | 0.34722 | Jolie 's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips .
146925 | 0.5 | Jones helps breathe some life into the insubstantial plot , but even he is overwhelmed by predictability .
146931 | 0.38889 | Judd 's characters ought to pick up the durable best seller Smart Women , Foolish Choices for advice .
146934 | 0.15278 | Julia is played with exasperating blandness by Laura Regan .
146939 | 0.22222 | Just a bloody mess .
146944 | 0.22222 | Just a string of stale gags , with no good inside dope , and no particular bite .
146946 | 0.58333 | Just an average comedic dateflick but not a waste of time .
146950 | 0.15278 | Just another disjointed , fairly predictable psychological thriller .
146952 | 0.23611 | Just because it really happened to you , honey , does n't mean that it 's interesting to anyone else .
146957 | 0.5 | Just how extreme are these ops ?
146960 | 0.16667 | Just like Hearst 's enormous yacht , it 's slow and unwieldy and takes a long time to reach its destination .
146962 | 0.44444 | Just like every other Seagal movie , only louder and without that silly ponytail .
146968 | 0.375 | Just one bad idea after another .
146972 | 0.44444 | Just one problem : Fish out of water usually die .
146974 | 0.29167 | Just when the movie seems confident enough to handle subtlety , it dives into soapy bathos .

146981 | 0.22222 | K-19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic , but it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy Saving Private Ryanovich .
147007 | 0.41667 | Kenneth Branagh 's energetic sweet-and-sour performance as a curmudgeonly British playwright grounds this overstuffed , erratic dramedy in which he and his improbably forbearing wife contend with craziness and child-rearing in Los Angeles .
147042 | 0.20833 | Kung Pow is Oedekerk 's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that .
147045 | 0.36111 | Kwan makes the mix-and - match metaphors intriguing , while lulling us into torpor with his cultivated allergy to action .
147057 | 0.25 | Lacking substance and soul , Crossroads comes up shorter than Britney 's cutoffs .
147059 | 0.19444 | Lacks heart , depth and , most of all , purpose .
147063 | 0.26389 | Laconic and very stilted in its dialogue , this indie flick never found its audience , probably because it 's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters .

147796 | 0.11111 | Not only unfunny , but downright repellent .
147798 | 0.375 | Not really bad so much as distasteful : We need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers .
147800 | 0.15278 | Not since Freddy Got Fingered has a major release been so painful to sit through .

147817 | 0.33333 | Nothing more or less than an outright bodice-ripper -- it should have ditched the artsy pretensions and revelled in the entertaining shallows .

147872 | 0.20833 | Offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs ... a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm .
147876 | 0.33333 | Oft-described as the antidote to American Pie-type sex comedies , it actually has a bundle in common with them , as the film diffuses every opportunity for a breakthrough
147885 | 0.58333 | On the bright side , it contains Jesse Ventura 's best work since the XFL .
147890 | 0.27778 | On the right track to something that 's creepy and effective ... It 's just going to take more than a man in a Bullwinkle costume to get there .
147892 | 0.19444 | On the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality .
147898 | 0.11111 | Once Ice-T sticks his mug in the window of the couple 's BMW and begins haranguing the wife in bad stage dialogue , all credibility flies out the window .
147902 | 0.34722 | Once the 50 year old Benigni appears as the title character , we find ourselves longing for the block of wood to come back .

147929 | 0.30556 | One problem with the movie , directed by Joel Schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time .

147983 | 0.51389 | Overall , it 's a pretty mediocre family film .
147985 | 0.22222 | Overall the film feels like a low-budget TV pilot that could not find a buyer to play it on the tube .
148009 | 0.22222 | Pap invested in undergraduate doubling subtexts and ridiculous stabs at existentialism reminding of the discovery of the wizard of God in the fifth Trek flick .
148022 | 0.44444 | Parker probably thinks he 's shaking up a classic the way Kenneth Branagh and Baz Luhrmann have , but this half-hearted messing-about just makes us miss Wilde 's still-contemporary play .
148026 | 0.40278 | Part comedy , part drama , the movie winds up accomplishing neither in full , and leaves us feeling touched and amused by several moments and ideas , but nevertheless dissatisfied with the movie as a whole .
148029 | 0.16667 | Partway through watching this saccharine , Easter-egg-colored concoction , you realize that it is made up of three episodes of a rejected TV show .

148059 | 0.26389 | Perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie .
148073 | 0.5 | Personal Velocity ought to be exploring these women 's inner lives , but it never moves beyond their surfaces .
148094 | 0.097222 | Philosophically , intellectually and logistically a mess .
148111 | 0.27778 | Places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller .
148116 | 0.33333 | Plays as hollow catharsis , with lots of tears but very little in the way of insights .

148262 | 0.20833 | Reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns , creating a meandering , inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film .
148276 | 0.44444 | Returning aggressively to his formula of dimwitted comedy and even dimmer characters , Sandler , who also executive produces , has made a film that makes previous vehicles look smart and sassy .

149437 | 0.5 | The film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , Southern California locations and star power .
149439 | 0.26389 | The film takes too long getting to the good stuff , then takes too long figuring out what to do next .
149442 | 0.25 | The filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it 's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women .

149501 | 0.5 | The kind of spectacularly misconceived enterprise that only a sophisticated cinephile could have perpetrated .
149506 | 0.34722 | The lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary .

149704 | 0.41667 | The pacing is glacial , the screenplay is stiff as a board , and things heat up only in the movie 's final scenes .
149717 | 0.25 | The performances are so leaden , Michael Rymer 's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud .
149724 | 0.25 | The picture , scored by a perversely cheerful Marcus Miller accordion\/harmonica\/banjo abomination , is a monument to bad in all its florid variety .
149725 | 0.31944 | The picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know-how mixes with lack of give-a-damn .
149727 | 0.31944 | The piquant story needs more dramatic meat on its bones .

149732 | 0.16667 | The plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience 's chain .
149733 | 0.19444 | The plot grinds on with yawn-provoking dullness .
149738 | 0.30556 | The plot has a number of holes , and at times it 's simply baffling .
149739 | 0.22222 | The plot is plastered with one Hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults .
149743 | 0.29167 | The plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before Sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset .
149745 | 0.20833 | The plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television - caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy .
149750 | 0.375 | The plot is very clever , but Boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of .
149752 | 0.15278 | The predominantly amateur cast is painful to watch , so stilted and unconvincing are the performances .
149758 | 0.29167 | The premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written ... in the thrall of a vicious hangover .
149763 | 0.18056 | The premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film 's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them .
149764 | 0.31944 | The premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the Clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences .
149765 | 0.26389 | The problem is n't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of Schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball .
149767 | 0.29167 | The problem is that the movie has no idea of it is serious or not .
149771 | 0.23611 | The problem with this film is that it 's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot .
149780 | 0.63889 | The production values are up there .
149790 | 0.5 | The reason I found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory .
149792 | 0.26389 | The reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone .
149794 | 0.51389 | The rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it 's more comedy than suspense De Palma creates .
149795 | 0.31944 | The result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a Halloween that died .
149796 | 0.33333 | The result is solemn and horrifying , yet strangely detached .
149799 | 0.38889 | The sad thing about Knockaround Guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film is n't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is .
149801 | 0.25 | The screenplay by James Eric , James Horton and director Peter O'Fallon ... is so pat it makes your teeth hurt .
149804 | 0.22222 | The screenplay sabotages the movie 's strengths at almost every juncture .
149814 | 0.36111 | The script boasts some tart TV-insider humor , but the film has not a trace of humanity or empathy .
149818 | 0.34722 | The script has less spice than a rat burger and The Rock 's fighting skills are more in line with Steven Seagal .
149819 | 0.20833 | The script is a tired one , with few moments of joy rising above the stale material .
149829 | 0.16667 | The sequel has turned completely and irrevocably bizarre to the point of utter nonsense .
149832 | 0.19444 | The sinister inspiration that fuelled DeVito 's early work is confused in Death to Smoochy into something both ugly and mindless .
149834 | 0.23611 | The situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels .
149837 | 0.16667 | The smug , oily demeanor that Donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named Pipe Dream is just repulsive .
149841 | 0.083333 | The sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap .
149847 | 0.27778 | The soul-searching deliberateness of the film , although leavened nicely with dry absurdist wit , eventually becomes too heavy for the plot .
149849 | 0.34722 | The stories here suffer from the chosen format .
149850 | 0.16667 | The story 's so preposterous that I did n't believe it for a second , despite the best efforts of everyone involved .
149851 | 0.125 | The story ... is moldy and obvious .
149854 | 0.34722 | The story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough .
149856 | 0.27778 | The story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you 're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships .
149857 | 0.23611 | The story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence .
149863 | 0.36111 | The story has its redundancies , and the young actors , not very experienced , are sometimes inexpressive .
149868 | 0.33333 | The story is -- forgive me -- a little thin , and the filmmaking clumsy and rushed .
149872 | 0.38889 | The story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly - stunning insight that crime does n't pay .
149878 | 0.38889 | The story is naturally poignant , but first-time screenwriter Paul Pender overloads it with sugary bits of business .
149880 | 0.20833 | The story the movie tells is of Brian De Palma 's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career .
149889 | 0.26389 | The streets , shot by cinematographer Michael Ballhaus , may be as authentic as they are mean , but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them .
149895 | 0.48611 | The stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious .
149897 | 0.625 | The structure the film takes may find Matt Damon and Ben Affleck once again looking for residuals as this officially completes a Good Will Hunting trilogy that was never planned .
149900 | 0 | The stupidest , most insulting movie of 2002 's first quarter .
149903 | 0.33333 | The subject of swinging still seems ripe for a documentary -- just not this one .
149913 | 0.29167 | The talented and clever Robert Rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film and did n't reserve enough for his second .
149919 | 0.41667 | The techno tux is good for a few laughs , as are Chan and Hewitt , but when such a good design turns out to be a cheap knockoff , we ca n't recommend anything but a rental for The Tuxedo .
149928 | 0.20833 | The thriller side of this movie is falling flat , as the stalker does n't do much stalking , and no cop or lawyer grasps the concept of actually investigating the case .
149931 | 0.38889 | The timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off .
149935 | 0.16667 | The title 's lameness should clue you in on how bad the movie is .
149937 | 0.375 | The title Trapped turns out to be a pretty fair description of how you feel while you 're watching this ultra-manipulative thriller .
149938 | 0.51389 | The title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you 'll read anywhere .
149944 | 0.23611 | The title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well .
149945 | 0.26389 | The tone shifts abruptly from tense to celebratory to soppy .
149947 | 0.27778 | The truth is that The Truth About Charlie gets increasingly tiresome .
149950 | 0.25 | The tug-of-war at the core of Beijing Bicycle becomes weighed down with agonizing contrivances , overheated pathos and long , wistful gazes .
149957 | 0.43056 | The twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows .
149962 | 0.33333 | The two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect .
149965 | 0.083333 | The unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive , the director just ends up exposing his own obsession .
149971 | 0.30556 | The verdict : Two bodies and hardly a laugh between them .
149985 | 0.27778 | The whole damn thing is ripe for the Jerry Springer crowd .
149988 | 0.22222 | The whole movie is simply a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well .
149990 | 0.20833 | The whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit .
149992 | 0.16667 | The words , ` Frankly , my dear , I do n't give a damn , ' have never been more appropriate .
149995 | 0.41667 | The worst kind of independent ; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 1970s predecessors
150002 | 0.38889 | The writers , director Wally Wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : Kappa Rho Alpha Phi .
150011 | 0.36111 | The young stars are too cute ; the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative ; the message is too blatant ; the resolutions are too convenient .
150018 | 0.69444 | Thekids will probably stay amused at the kaleidoscope of big , colorful characters .
150020 | 0.38889 | Then lower them a bit more .
150023 | 0.38889 | Theology aside , why put someone who ultimately does n't learn at the center of a kids ' story ?
150029 | 0.54167 | There 's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of Queen of the Damned , as its origins in an Anne Rice novel dictate , but generally , it 's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance .
150030 | 0.43056 | There 's a disturbing ` Great White Hope ' undertone to The Other Side of Heaven that subtly undermines its message of Christian love and compassion .
150035 | 0.41667 | There 's a solid woman - finding-herself story somewhere in here , but you 'd have to dig pretty deep to uncover it .
150040 | 0.38889 | There 's an audience for it , but it could have been funnier and more innocent .
150041 | 0.23611 | There 's enough melodrama in this Magnolia Primavera to make PTA proud yet director Muccino 's characters are less worthy of Puccini than they are of daytime television .
150044 | 0.33333 | There 's more scatological action in 8 Crazy Nights than a proctologist is apt to encounter in an entire career .
150049 | 0.36111 | There 's no denying the elaborateness of the artist 's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity .
150052 | 0.30556 | There 's no excuse for following up a delightful , well-crafted family film with a computer-generated cold fish .
150053 | 0.44444 | There 's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the Disney classic , and even that of the excellent 1934 MGM version .
150055 | 0.18056 | There 's no palpable chemistry between Lopez and male lead Ralph Fiennes , plus the script by Working Girl scribe Kevin Wade is workmanlike in the extreme .
150056 | 0.44444 | There 's no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct where it all went wrong .
150058 | 0.33333 | There 's not a spark of new inspiration in it , just more of the same , done with noticeably less energy and imagination .
150059 | 0.22222 | There 's not enough here to justify the almost two hours .
150060 | 0.29167 | There 's not enough to sustain the comedy .
150061 | 0.41667 | There 's not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in Point Pleasant .
150062 | 0.26389 | There 's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought .
150063 | 0.34722 | There 's plenty of style in Guillermo Del Toro 's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply ca n't sustain more than 90 minutes .
150064 | 0.44444 | There 's something deeply creepy about Never Again , a new arrow in Schaeffer 's quiver of ineptitudes .
150065 | 0.20833 | There 's something fundamental missing from this story : something or someone to care about .
150066 | 0.5 | There 's something not entirely convincing about The Quiet American .
150074 | 0.45833 | There 's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like Lavinia , to go the conservative route .
150080 | 0.23611 | There 's suspension of disbelief and then there 's bad screenwriting ... this film packs a wallop of the latter .
150085 | 0.20833 | There 's too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging .
150086 | 0.25 | There are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust .
150087 | 0.30556 | There are films that try the patience of even the most cinema-besotted critic -- and this was one of them .
150089 | 0.54167 | There are n't many laughs in this interesting study of the cultural mores of Georgian Jews in Tel Aviv .
150090 | 0.16667 | There are plot holes big enough for Shamu the killer whale to swim through .
150094 | 0.20833 | There are simply too many ideas floating around -- part farce , part Sliding Doors , part pop video -- and yet failing to exploit them .
150099 | 0.30556 | There are touching moments in Etoiles , but for the most part this is a dull , dour documentary on what ought to be a joyful or at least fascinating subject .
150104 | 0.27778 | There are weird resonances between actor and role here , and they 're not exactly flattering .
150106 | 0.45833 | There is an almost poignant dimension to the way that every major stunt Seagal 's character ... performs is shot from behind , as if it could fool us into thinking that we 're not watching a double .
150107 | 0.30556 | There is n't nearly enough fun here , despite the presence of some appealing ingredients .
150112 | 0.20833 | There is no entry portal in The Rules of Attraction , and I spent most of the movie feeling depressed by the shallow , selfish , greedy characters .
150113 | 0.59722 | There is no insight into the anguish of Heidi 's life -- only a depiction of pain , today 's version of Greek tragedy , the talk-show guest decrying her fate .

182637 | 0.25 | At every opportunity to do something clever , the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability ... all you have left is a no-surprise series of explosions and violence while Banderas looks like he 's not trying to laugh at how bad it
182638 | 0.83333 | At least it 's a fairly impressive debut from the director , Charles Stone III .
182642 | 0.30556 | At once overly old-fashioned in its sudsy plotting and heavy-handed in its effort to modernize it with encomia to diversity and tolerance .
182644 | 0.34722 | At three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue .
182645 | 0.11111 | At times , it actually hurts to watch .
182660 | 0.27778 | Attal 's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare I say , outdated , it 's a wonder that he could n't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident .
182661 | 0.16667 | Attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama .
182672 | 0.43056 | Authentic , and at times endearing , humorous , spooky , educational , but at other times as bland as a block of snow .

182728 | 0.083333 | Bears is even worse than I imagined a movie ever could be .
182734 | 0.18056 | Because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work , the movie contains no wit , only labored gags .

182743 | 0.20833 | Becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any Plympton film : boring .

182760 | 0.31944 | Behan 's memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best Irish sense -- but Sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance .

182783 | 0.40278 | Benigni 's Pinocchio is extremely straight and mind-numbingly stilted , its episodic pacing keeping the film from developing any storytelling flow .
182792 | 0.47222 | Best described as I Know What You Did Last Winter .
182809 | 0.65278 | Birot creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters .
182820 | 0.55556 | Blade II has a brilliant director and charismatic star , but it suffers from rampant vampire devaluation .
182844 | 0.20833 | Blood Work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from Eastwood 's Dirty Harry period .

182870 | 0.16667 | Boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect .

182887 | 0.43056 | Brainy , artistic and muted , almost to the point of suffocation .
182894 | 0.48611 | Bravo reveals the true intent of her film by carefully selecting interview subjects who will construct a portrait of Castro so predominantly charitable it can only be seen as propaganda .

182921 | 0.22222 | Broder 's screenplay is shallow , offensive and redundant , with pitifully few real laughs .
182933 | 0.22222 | Broomfield 's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient .
182936 | 0.30556 | Brosnan 's finest non-Bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film 's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes .

182980 | 0.54167 | Ca n't seem to get anywhere near the story 's center .
182983 | 0.38889 | Cacoyannis ' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts .

183002 | 0.23611 | Can be classified as one of those ` alternate reality ' movies ... except that it would have worked so much better dealing in only one reality .
183016 | 0.20833 | Carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , Chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , ` If I stay positive , maybe I can channel one of my greatest pictures , Drunken Master . '

183077 | 0.23611 | Cherish is a dud -- a romantic comedy that 's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny .
183078 | 0.36111 | Cherish would 've worked a lot better had it been a short film .
183079 | 0.30556 | Cherry Orchard is badly edited , often awkwardly directed and suffers from the addition of a wholly unnecessary pre-credit sequence designed to give some of the characters a ` back story . '

183139 | 0.18056 | Co-writer\/director Jonathan Parker 's attempts to fashion a Brazil-like , hyper-real satire fall dreadfully short .
183142 | 0.069444 | Coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock .
183147 | 0.055556 | Cold , Sterile And Lacking Any Color Or Warmth .
183150 | 0.26389 | Cold , pretentious , thoroughly dislikable study in sociopathy .

183159 | 0.25 | Collapses under its own meager weight .
183164 | 0.52778 | Collateral Damage offers formula payback and the Big Payoff , but the explosions tend to simply hit their marks , pyro-correctly .
183175 | 0.23611 | Comes across as a fairly weak retooling .
183178 | 0.11111 | Comes off as a long , laborious whine , the bellyaching of a paranoid and unlikable man .

183194 | 0.25 | Content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance .
183196 | 0.13889 | Contrived , maudlin and cliche-ridden ... if this sappy script was the best the contest received , those rejected must have been astronomically bad .

183212 | 0.20833 | Costner 's warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as Shadyac 's perfunctory directing chops , and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink Laurence Olivier .
183219 | 0.19444 | Cox offers plenty of glimpses at existing photos , but there are no movies of Nijinsky , so instead the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge .
183236 | 0.097222 | Crossroads feels like a teenybopper Ed Wood film , replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo and the high-strung but flaccid drama .

183335 | 0.70833 | Deliberately and devotedly constructed , Far from Heaven is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate .
183338 | 0.38889 | Demme finally succeeds in diminishing his stature from Oscar-winning master to lowly studio hack .
183343 | 0.30556 | Demme gets a lot of flavor and spice into his Charade remake , but he ca n't disguise that he 's spiffing up leftovers that are n't so substantial or fresh .
183358 | 0.083333 | Derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone .

183362 | 0.30556 | Deserving of its critical backlash and more .

183369 | 0.33333 | Despite Juliet Stevenon 's attempt to bring cohesion to Pamela 's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs .
183371 | 0.15278 | Despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless .
183373 | 0.26389 | Despite its dry wit and compassion , the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing .
183375 | 0.25 | Despite its promising cast of characters , Big Trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that ` zany ' does n't necessarily mean ` funny . '
183377 | 0.48611 | Despite its raucous intent , XXX is as conventional as a Nike ad and as rebellious as spring break .
183379 | 0.27778 | Despite its sincere acting , Signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype .
183381 | 0.25 | Despite its visual virtuosity , ` Naqoyqatsi ' is banal in its message and the choice of material to convey it .
183383 | 0.22222 | Despite slick production values and director Roger Michell 's tick-tock pacing , the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours .

184887 | 0.75 | In between the icy stunts , the actors spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and ` just letting the mountain tell you what to do . '
184889 | 0.48611 | In gleefully , thumpingly hyperbolic terms , it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass , jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz .
184891 | 0.40278 | In his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , Silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls .
184893 | 0.29167 | In his role of observer of the scene , Lawrence sounds whiny and defensive , as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature .
184895 | 0.041667 | In my own very humble opinion , In Praise of Love lacks even the most fragmented charms I have found in almost all of his previous works .
184904 | 0.22222 | In spite of featuring a script credited to no fewer than five writers , apparently nobody here bothered to check it twice .
184906 | 0.19444 | In terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused .
184909 | 0.38889 | In the end , Tuck Everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived : too much to do , too little time to do it in .
184910 | 0.27778 | In the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we 're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses .
184911 | 0.11111 | In the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about Kennedy 's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate .
184912 | 0.16667 | In the end , there is n't much to it .
184917 | 0.34722 | In the spirit of the season , I assign one bright shining star to Roberto Benigni 's Pinocchio -- but I guarantee that no wise men will be following after it .
184921 | 0.55556 | In this film , Aussie David Caesar channels the not-quite-dead career of Guy Ritchie .
184922 | 0.44444 | In this film we at least see a study in contrasts ; the wide range of one actor , and the limited range of a comedian .
184942 | 0.54167 | Initial strangeness inexorably gives way to rote sentimentality and mystical tenderness becomes narrative expedience .
184945 | 0.61111 | Initially gripping , eventually cloying POW drama .
184947 | 0.097222 | Instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the X Games , we get a cinematic postcard that 's superficial and unrealized .
184949 | 0.16667 | Instead of letting the laughs come as they may , Lawrence unleashes his trademark misogyny -- er , comedy -- like a human volcano or an overflowing septic tank , take your pick .
184953 | 0.27778 | Instead of using George and Lucy 's most obvious differences to ignite sparks , Lawrence desperately looks elsewhere , seizing on George 's haplessness and Lucy 's personality tics .
184957 | 0.61111 | Interesting and thoroughly unfaithful version of Carmen
184962 | 0.19444 | Interminably bleak , to say nothing of boring .
184968 | 0.38889 | Interview With the Assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its Blair Witch Project real-time roots .
184984 | 0.30556 | Is it possible for a documentary to be utterly entranced by its subject and still show virtually no understanding of it ?
184986 | 0.25 | Is it really an advantage to invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets ?
184988 | 0.27778 | Is n't it a bit early in his career for director Barry Sonnenfeld to do a homage to himself ?
184996 | 0.22222 | It 's a Frankenstein-monster of a film that does n't know what it wants to be .
185000 | 0.13889 | It 's a bad action movie because there 's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring .
185001 | 0.083333 | It 's a barely tolerable slog over well-trod ground .
185006 | 0.22222 | It 's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled .
185007 | 0.65278 | It 's a boring movie about a boring man , made watchable by a bravura performance from a consummate actor incapable of being boring .
185013 | 0.5 | It 's a documentary that says that the alternate sexuality meant to set you free may require so much relationship maintenance that celibacy can start looking good .
185015 | 0.055556 | It 's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer 's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary .
185016 | 0.11111 | It 's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt Miramax felt they owed to Benigni .
185017 | 0.5 | It 's a gag that 's worn a bit thin over the years , though Do n't Ask still finds a few chuckles .
185022 | 0.25 | It 's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it does n't offer any insights that have n't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the Dahmer heyday of the mid - '90s .
185028 | 0.22222 | It 's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as Phoenix 's .
185029 | 0.91667 | It 's a masterpiece .
185030 | 0.27778 | It 's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex .
185032 | 0.33333 | It 's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition .
185033 | 0.125 | It 's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns .
185034 | 0.19444 | It 's a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes ... finally seem so impersonal or even shallow .
185036 | 0.125 | It 's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch .
185038 | 0.30556 | It 's a thin notion , repetitively stretched out to feature length , awash in self-consciously flashy camera effects , droning house music and flat , flat dialogue .
185042 | 0.40278 | It 's actually pretty funny , but in all the wrong places .
185046 | 0.40278 | It 's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick .
185050 | 0.36111 | It 's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it 's all about the silences and if you 're into that , have at it .
185051 | 0.5 | It 's all gratuitous before long , as if Schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story .
185052 | 0.125 | It 's all surface psychodramatics .
185053 | 0.41667 | It 's almost as if it 's an elaborate dare more than a full-blooded film .
185054 | 0.27778 | It 's also built on a faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness .
185058 | 0.36111 | It 's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise .
185059 | 0.38889 | It 's as if Allen , at 66 , has stopped challenging himself .
185071 | 0.18056 | It 's as sorry a mess as its director 's diabolical debut , Mad Cows .
185072 | 0.72222 | It 's at once laughable and compulsively watchable , in its committed dumbness .
185073 | 0.25 | It 's bedeviled by labored writing and slack direction .
185085 | 0.20833 | It 's better suited for the history or biography channel , but there 's no arguing the tone of the movie - it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and questions on your mind .
185086 | 0.25 | It 's clear why Deuces Wild , which was shot two years ago , has been gathering dust on MGM 's shelf .
185091 | 0.36111 | It 's coherent , well shot , and tartly acted , but it wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate .
185092 | 0.041667 | It 's crap on a leash -- far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of Joe Dante 's similarly styled Gremlins .
185094 | 0.40278 | It 's deep-sixed by a compulsion to catalog every bodily fluids gag in There 's Something About Mary and devise a parallel clone-gag .
185099 | 0.375 | It 's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and I think even fans of Sandler 's comic taste may find it uninteresting .
185100 | 0.25 | It 's depressing to see how far Herzog has fallen .
185101 | 0.5 | It 's difficult for a longtime admirer of his work to not be swept up in Invincible and overlook its drawbacks .
185102 | 0.13889 | It 's difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in Slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny .
185103 | 0.40278 | It 's difficult to discern if this is a crazy work of disturbed genius or merely 90 minutes of post-adolescent Electra rebellion .
185104 | 0.22222 | It 's difficult to feel anything much while watching this movie , beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting .
185105 | 0.083333 | It 's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 .
185106 | 0.083333 | It 's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast .
185107 | 0.56944 | It 's everything you 'd expect -- but nothing more .
185108 | 0.36111 | It 's exactly the kind of movie Toback 's detractors always accuse him of making .
185109 | 0.54167 | It 's exactly what you 'd expect .
185110 | 0.45833 | It 's fitfully funny but never really takes off .
185111 | 0.75 | It 's funny , as the old saying goes , because it 's true .
185116 | 0.43056 | It 's hard to believe that a relationship like Holly and Marina 's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive .
185117 | 0.22222 | It 's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby .
185118 | 0.20833 | It 's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress .
185119 | 0.18056 | It 's hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie .
185120 | 0.125 | It 's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread .
185128 | 0.19444 | It 's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie .
185132 | 0.19444 | It 's horribly depressing and not very well done .
185133 | 0.27778 | It 's in the action scenes that things fall apart .
185136 | 0.45833 | It 's just plain boring .
185137 | 0.13889 | It 's just rather leaden and dull .
185142 | 0.23611 | It 's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness , and where Human Nature should be ingratiating , it 's just grating .
185143 | 0.20833 | It 's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey .
185144 | 0.5 | It 's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another .
185145 | 0.26389 | It 's like a drive-by .
185147 | 0.22222 | It 's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay .
185148 | 0.22222 | It 's makes a better travelogue than movie .
185149 | 0.25 | It 's mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist ... studiously inoffensive and completely disposable .
185150 | 0.48611 | It 's mindless junk like this that makes you appreciate original romantic comedies like Punch-Drunk Love .
185155 | 0.61111 | It 's neither as sappy as Big Daddy nor as anarchic as Happy Gilmore or The Waterboy , but it has its moments .
185161 | 0.5 | It 's not a bad plot ; but , unfortunately , the movie is nowhere near as refined as all the classic dramas it borrows from .
185166 | 0.45833 | It 's not a particularly good film , but neither is it a monsterous one .
185168 | 0.20833 | It 's not helpful to listen to extremist name-calling , regardless of whether you think Kissinger was a calculating fiend or just a slippery self-promoter .
185169 | 0.20833 | It 's not original enough .
185176 | 0.40278 | It 's not the worst comedy of the year , but it certainly wo n't win any honors .
185181 | 0.22222 | It 's not too much of anything .
185191 | 0.16667 | It 's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling .
185196 | 0.31944 | It 's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by Taylor 's cartoonish performance and the film 's ill-considered notion that Hitler 's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances .
185197 | 0.19444 | It 's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the Cannes Film Festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere .
185201 | 0.34722 | It 's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline ; everything that 's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that 's just too boring and obvious .
185202 | 0.54167 | It 's really just another silly Hollywood action film , one among a multitude of simple-minded , yahoo-ing death shows .
185206 | 0.875 | It 's refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy ; Diesel , with his brawny frame and cool , composed delivery , fits the bill perfectly .
185208 | 0.15278 | It 's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even Jason X ... look positively Shakesperean by comparison .
185209 | 0.33333 | It 's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead .
185210 | 0.26389 | It 's so tedious that it makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in Bridget Jones 's Diary .
185214 | 0.45833 | It 's supposed to be a humorous , all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up .
185218 | 0.23611 | It 's supposed to be a romantic comedy - it suffers from too much Norma Rae and not enough Pretty Woman .
185219 | 0.097222 | It 's supposed to be post-feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on Oprah .
185220 | 0.29167 | It 's surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction .
185225 | 0.45833 | It 's sweet ... but just a little bit too precious at the start and a little too familiar at the end .
185227 | 0.97222 | It 's the funniest American comedy since Graffiti Bridge .
185228 | 0.25 | It 's the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who does n't think about percentages all day long .
185229 | 0.88889 | It 's the kind of movie that , aside from Robert Altman , Spike Lee , the Coen Brothers and a few others , our moviemakers do n't make often enough .
185230 | 0.083333 | It 's the kind of under-inspired , overblown enterprise that gives Hollywood sequels a bad name .
185231 | 0.41667 | It 's the movie equivalent of a sweaty old guy in a rain coat shopping for cheap porn .
185232 | 0.40278 | It 's too bad nothing else is .
185233 | 0.44444 | It 's tough being a black man in America , especially when the Man has taken away your car , your work-hours and denied you health insurance .
185234 | 0.11111 | It 's tough to be startled when you 're almost dozing .
185235 | 0.29167 | It 's tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie , directed by Scott Kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 Brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo .
185236 | 0.30556 | It 's unfortunate that Wallace , who wrote Gibson 's Braveheart as well as the recent Pearl Harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue .
185238 | 0.16667 | It aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one .
185240 | 0.20833 | It all seemed wasted like DeNiro 's once promising career and the once grand Long Beach boardwalk .
185241 | 0.27778 | It all starts to smack of a Hallmark Hall of Fame , with a few four letter words thrown in that are generally not heard on television .
185246 | 0.19444 | It all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense .
185247 | 0.26389 | It almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us .
185248 | 0.041667 | It appears as if even the filmmakers did n't know what kind of movie they were making .
185249 | 0.13889 | It appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept .
185255 | 0.48611 | It briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest - -- audience sadism -- is evaded completely .
185263 | 0.18056 | It could have been something special , but two things drag it down to mediocrity -- director Clare Peploe 's misunderstanding of Marivaux 's rhythms , and Mira Sorvino 's limitations as a classical actress .
185264 | 0.25 | It dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum .
185269 | 0.027778 | It desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time .
185271 | 0.26389 | It does n't offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is , or even its attitude toward its subject .
185273 | 0.16667 | It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a Mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that .
185274 | 0.26389 | It drowns in sap .
185275 | 0.18056 | It ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors .
185276 | 0.22222 | It feels like very light Errol Morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs .
185281 | 0.25 | It follows the Blair Witch formula for an hour , in which we 're told something creepy and vague is in the works , and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes .
185282 | 0.72222 | It goes down easy , leaving virtually no aftertaste .
185283 | 0.13889 | It goes on for too long and bogs down in a surfeit of characters and unnecessary subplots .
185284 | 0.375 | It has become apparent that the franchise 's best years are long past .
185285 | 0.29167 | It has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie , which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline .
185287 | 0.23611 | It has the air of a surprisingly juvenile lark , a pop-influenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent and wear thin with repetition .
185288 | 0.26389 | It has the requisite faux-urban vibe and hotter-two-years-ago rap and R&B names and references .
185293 | 0.5 | It has the right approach and the right opening premise , but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material .
185294 | 0.38889 | It is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment .
185295 | 0.125 | It is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously .
185296 | 0.083333 | It is depressing , ruthlessly pained and depraved , the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound .
185298 | 0.5 | It is one more celluloid testimonial to the cruelties experienced by Southern blacks as distilled through a Caucasian perspective .
185299 | 0.29167 | It is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill
185300 | 0.40278 | It is so earnest , so overwrought and so wildly implausible that it begs to be parodied .
185304 | 0.31944 | It just goes to show , an intelligent person is n't necessarily an admirable storyteller .
185310 | 0.33333 | It looks good , but it is essentially empty .
185311 | 0.43056 | It looks much more like a cartoon in the end than The Simpsons ever has .
185312 | 0.27778 | It made me realize that we really have n't had a good cheesy B-movie playing in theaters since ... well ... since last week 's Reign of Fire .
185313 | 0.125 | It makes even Elizabeth Hurley seem graceless and ugly .
185318 | 0.23611 | It merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them .
185323 | 0.125 | It might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the Saturday morning cartoons -- a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness .
185326 | 0.61111 | It never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time .
185327 | 0.33333 | It never rises to its clever what-if concept .
185334 | 0.33333 | It reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it .
185339 | 0.47222 | It shares the first two films ' loose-jointed structure , but laugh-out-loud bits are few and far between .
185340 | 0.19444 | It should be doing a lot of things , but does n't .
185346 | 0.20833 | It should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring .
185351 | 0.375 | It sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that 's more or less how it plays out .
185352 | 0.29167 | It stars schticky Chris Rock and stolid Anthony Hopkins , who seem barely in the same movie .
185364 | 0.43056 | It tells its story in a flat manner and leaves you with the impression that you should have gotten more out of it than you did .
185366 | 0.45833 | It was a dark and stormy night ...
185367 | 0.25 | It would n't matter so much that this arrogant Richard Pryor wannabe 's routine is offensive , puerile and unimaginatively foul-mouthed if it was at least funny .
185378 | 0.33333 | Its and pieces of The Hot Chick are so hilarious , and Schneider 's performance is so fine , it 's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in The Animal -- is a slapdash mess .
185380 | 0.29167 | Its appeal will probably limited to LDS Church members and undemanding armchair tourists .
185383 | 0.27778 | Its audacious ambitions sabotaged by pomposity , Steven Soderbergh 's space opera emerges as a numbingly dull experience .
185386 | 0.30556 | Its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie 's presentation , which is way too stagy .
185390 | 0.33333 | Its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche .
185393 | 0.5 | Its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up .
185395 | 0.36111 | Its message has merit and , in the hands of a brutally honest individual like Prophet Jack , might have made a point or two regarding life .
185401 | 0.36111 | Its premise is smart , but the execution is pretty weary .
185403 | 0.375 | Its screenplay serves as auto-critique , and its clumsiness as its own most damning censure .
185409 | 0.23611 | Its simplicity puts an exclamation point on the fact that this is n't something to be taken seriously , but it also wrecks any chance of the movie rising above similar fare .
185411 | 0.58333 | Its strengths and weaknesses play off each other virtually to a stand-off , with the unfortunate trump card being the dreary mid-section of the film .
185454 | 0.23611 | Jaw-droppingly superficial , straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as John Ritter 's glory days on Three 's Company .
185506 | 0.56944 | Jonah is only so-so ... the addition of a biblical message will either improve the film for you , or it will lessen it .
185517 | 0.22222 | Julie Davis is the Kathie Lee Gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego does n't always go hand in hand with talent .
185529 | 0.61111 | Juliette Binoche 's Sand is vivacious , but it 's hard to sense that powerhouse of 19th-century prose behind her childlike smile .
185536 | 0.19444 | Just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that 's neither original nor terribly funny .
185539 | 0.27778 | Just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another , making Ararat far more demanding than it needs to be .
185543 | 0.29167 | Just consider what New Best Friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay .
185545 | 0.15278 | Just dreadful .
185550 | 0.54167 | Just entertaining enough not to hate , too mediocre to love .

187954 | 0.15278 | The attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show .
187960 | 0.29167 | The author 's devotees will probably find it fascinating ; others may find it baffling .
187977 | 0.51389 | The beautiful , unusual music is this film 's chief draw , but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep .
187979 | 0.72222 | The best thing about the movie is its personable , amusing cast .
187981 | 0.22222 | The big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing .
187991 | 0.69444 | The bottom line with Nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series : Fans will undoubtedly enjoy it , and the uncommitted need n't waste their time on it .
187997 | 0.625 | The campy results make Mel Brooks ' Borscht Belt schtick look sophisticated .
188002 | 0.44444 | The cast has a high time , but de Broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp .
188004 | 0.47222 | The central character is n't complex enough to hold our interest .
188008 | 0.30556 | The characterizations and dialogue lack depth or complexity , with the ironic exception of Scooter .
188012 | 0.34722 | The characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality .
188013 | 0.18056 | The characters ... are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script .
188020 | 0.45833 | The characters are interesting and the relationship between Yosuke and Saeko is worth watching as it develops , but there 's not enough to the story to fill two hours .
188024 | 0.16667 | The characters are so generic and the plot so bland that even as rogue CIA assassins working for Chris Cooper 's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac , we do n't feel much for Damon\/Bourne or his predicament .
188030 | 0.23611 | The characters seem one-dimensional , and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience .
188033 | 0.36111 | The chocolate factory without Charlie .
188036 | 0.31944 | The cinematic equivalent of patronizing a bar favored by pretentious , untalented artistes who enjoy moaning about their cruel fate .
188038 | 0.36111 | The colorful Masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of Ganesh 's rise up the social ladder .
188042 | 0.75 | The concept is a hoot .
188050 | 0.31944 | The connected stories of Breitbart and Hanussen are actually fascinating , but the filmmaking in Invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice .
188052 | 0.15278 | The crap continues .
188055 | 0.31944 | The crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise .

188064 | 0.25 | The darker elements of misogyny and unprovoked violence suffocate the illumination created by the two daughters and the sparse instances of humor meant to shine through the gloomy film noir veil .
188067 | 0.23611 | The densest distillation of Roberts ' movies ever made .
188071 | 0.22222 | The dialogue is cumbersome , the simpering soundtrack and editing more so .

188079 | 0.43056 | The dose is strong and funny , for the first 15 minutes anyway ; after that , the potency wanes dramatically .
188080 | 0.23611 | The drama discloses almost nothing .
188086 | 0.26389 | The dramatic scenes are frequently unintentionally funny , and the action sequences -- clearly the main event -- are surprisingly uninvolving .
188089 | 0.15278 | The emotional overload of female angst irreparably drags the film down .
188092 | 0.51389 | The entire movie is filled with deja vu moments .
188093 | 0.19444 | The entire movie is in need of a scented bath .
188103 | 0.20833 | The entire point of a shaggy dog story , of course , is that it goes nowhere , and this is classic nowheresville in every sense .

188115 | 0.61111 | The exploitative , clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors .
188120 | 0.29167 | The explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me .
188122 | 0.20833 | The fact that the ` best part ' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of Demme 's good films does n't bode well for the rest of it .
188126 | 0.22222 | The feature-length stretch ... strains the show 's concept .
188131 | 0.47222 | The film 's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings , especially in the last few cloying moments .
188136 | 0.27778 | The film 's final hour , where nearly all the previous unseen material resides , is unconvincing soap opera that Tornatore was right to cut .
188141 | 0.20833 | The film 's hero is a bore and his innocence soon becomes a questionable kind of inexcusable dumb innocence .
188144 | 0.20833 | The film 's maudlin focus on the young woman 's infirmity and her naive dreams play like the worst kind of Hollywood heart-string plucking .
188149 | 0.51389 | The film 's stagecrafts are intimate and therefore bolder than the otherwise calculated artifice that defines and overwhelms the film 's production design .
188154 | 0.20833 | The film 's thoroughly recycled plot and tiresome jokes ... drag the movie down .
188156 | 0 | The film 's trailer also looked like crap , so crap is what I was expecting .
188159 | 0.36111 | The film , like Jimmy 's routines , could use a few good laughs .
188165 | 0.63889 | The film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances , but the result is disappointing .
188168 | 0.18056 | The film desperately sinks further and further into comedy futility .
188174 | 0.54167 | The film did n't move me one way or the other , but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due .
188176 | 0.20833 | The film does n't really care about the thousands of Americans who die hideously , it cares about how Ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the CIA .
188177 | 0.26389 | The film does n't show enough of the creative process or even of what was created for the non-fan to figure out what makes Wilco a big deal .

188188 | 0.18056 | The film has a nearly terminal case of the cutes , and it 's neither as funny nor as charming as it thinks it is .
188189 | 0.20833 | The film has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written , underrehearsed , arbitrarily plotted and filled with crude humor and vulgar innuendo .
188190 | 0.52778 | The film has too many spots where it 's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that 's especially fit for the kiddies .
188191 | 0.26389 | The film is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama .
188192 | 0.16667 | The film is all over the place , really .
188194 | 0.23611 | The film is grossly contradictory in conveying its social message , if indeed there is one .
188195 | 0.25 | The film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters .
188197 | 0.055556 | The film is so bad it does n't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen .
188198 | 0.16667 | The film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own .
188199 | 0.29167 | The film is so packed with subplots involving the various Silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a TV series than a feature film .

188201 | 0.375 | The film is ultimately about as inspiring as a Hallmark card .
188202 | 0.33333 | The film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold .
188206 | 0.31944 | The film is way too full of itself ; it 's stuffy and pretentious in a give-me-an-Oscar kind of way .
188207 | 0.23611 | The film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil .
188208 | 0.27778 | The film never finds its tone and several scenes run too long .
188209 | 0.36111 | The film never gets over its own investment in conventional arrangements , in terms of love , age , gender , race , and class .
188213 | 0.18056 | The film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes -- it 's insanely violent and very graphic .
188214 | 0.51389 | The film tries to touch on spousal abuse but veers off course and becomes just another revenge film .
188215 | 0.5 | The film virtually chokes on its own self-consciousness .
188220 | 0.59722 | The filmmaker 's heart is in the right place ...
188225 | 0.44444 | The filmmaker ascends , literally , to the Olympus of the art world , but he would have done well to end this flawed , dazzling series with the raising of something other than his own cremaster .
188228 | 0.22222 | The filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart .
188233 | 0.61111 | The filmmakers know how to please the eye , but it is not always the prettiest pictures that tell the best story .
188234 | 0.30556 | The filmmakers needed more emphasis on the storytelling and less on the glamorous machine that thrusts the audience into a future they wo n't much care about .
188236 | 0.34722 | The first hour is tedious though Ford and Neeson capably hold our interest , but its just not a thrilling movie .
188239 | 0.23611 | The first mistake , I suspect , is casting Shatner as a legendary professor and Kunis as a brilliant college student -- where 's Pauly Shore as the rocket scientist ?
188253 | 0.31944 | The gifted Crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself , and his cipherlike personality and bad behavior would play fine if the movie knew what to do with him .
188258 | 0.41667 | The good is very , very good ... The rest runs from mildly unimpressive to despairingly awful .
188262 | 0.41667 | The good thing -- the only good thing -- about Extreme Ops is that it 's so inane that it gave me plenty of time to ponder my Thanksgiving to-do list .
188264 | 0.27778 | The great pity is that those responsible did n't cut their losses -- and ours -- and retitle it The Adventures of Direct-to-Video Nash , and send it to its proper home .
188271 | 0.25 | The high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : There 's very little hustling on view .
188274 | 0.23611 | The histrionic muse still eludes Madonna and , playing a charmless witch , she is merely a charmless witch .
188280 | 0.22222 | The holes in this film remain agape -- holes punched through by an inconsistent , meandering , and sometimes dry plot .
188284 | 0.26389 | The idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of Run Lola Run .
188291 | 0.63889 | The irony is that this film 's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own .
188293 | 0.22222 | The jokes are telegraphed so far in advance they must have been lost in the mail .
188300 | 0.27778 | The kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored , cheering the pratfalls but little else ; their parents , wise folks that they are , read books .
188302 | 0.083333 | The kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill-advised and poorly executed idea .
188304 | 0.38889 | The kind of movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics .
188307 | 0.47222 | The last three narcissists left on earth compete for each others ' affections .
188308 | 0.34722 | The latest vapid actor 's exercise to appropriate the structure of Arthur Schnitzler 's Reigen .

188312 | 0.19444 | The lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma .
188314 | 0.083333 | The leads are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer 's secondhand material .
188316 | 0.25 | The leads we are given here are simply too bland to be interesting .
188318 | 0.375 | The locale ... remains far more interesting than the story at hand .
188321 | 0.19444 | The logic of it all will be Greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie 's rude and crude humor .
188323 | 0.29167 | The lousy John Q all but spits out Denzel Washington 's fine performance in the title role .
188325 | 0.20833 | The lousy lead performances ... keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired .
188327 | 0.18056 | The main characters are simply named The Husband , The Wife and The Kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort .
188330 | 0.34722 | The major problem with Windtalkers is that the bulk of the movie centers on the wrong character .
188342 | 0.31944 | The material and the production itself are little more than routine .
188348 | 0.34722 | The metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery .
188354 | 0.36111 | The milieu is wholly unconvincing ... and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch .
188356 | 0.375 | The modern-day characters are nowhere near as vivid as the 19th-century ones .
188358 | 0.26389 | The most excruciating 86 minutes one might sit through this summer that do not involve a dentist drill .
188363 | 0.41667 | The most ill-conceived animated comedy since the 1991 dog Rover Dangerfield .
188372 | 0.15278 | The most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters .
188374 | 0.20833 | The movie 's biggest shocks come from seeing former nymphette Juliette Lewis playing a salt-of-the-earth mommy named Minnie and watching Slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable Halloween costume shop would ever try to sell .
188376 | 0.375 | The movie 's blatant derivativeness is one reason it 's so lackluster .
188380 | 0.58333 | The movie 's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating , though , even if the movie itself does n't stand a ghost of a chance .
188382 | 0.52778 | The movie 's heavy-handed screenplay navigates a fast fade into pomposity and pretentiousness .
188390 | 0.26389 | The movie 's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it 's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had .
188392 | 0.15278 | The movie 's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh .
188395 | 0.16667 | The movie 's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase ` fatal script error . '
188401 | 0.19444 | The movie 's ultimate point -- that everyone should be themselves -- is trite , but the screenwriter and director Michel Gondry restate it to the point of ridiculousness .
188404 | 0.34722 | The movie 's vision of a white American zealously spreading a Puritanical brand of Christianity to South Seas islanders is one only a true believer could relish .
188413 | 0.58333 | The movie certainly has its share of clever moments and biting dialogue , but there 's just not much lurking below its abstract surface .
188414 | 0.52778 | The movie does has some entertainment value - how much depends on how well you like Chris Rock .
188415 | 0.27778 | The movie does n't generate a lot of energy .
188417 | 0.30556 | The movie does such an excellent job of critiquing itself at every faltering half-step of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating .
188419 | 0.25 | The movie generates plot points with a degree of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing .
188420 | 0.47222 | The movie has generic virtues , and despite a lot of involved talent , seems done by the numbers .
188424 | 0.43056 | The movie is a little tired ; maybe the original inspiration has run its course .
188425 | 0.20833 | The movie is a negligible work of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents .
188426 | 0.055556 | The movie is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive .
188427 | 0.055556 | The movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction .
188432 | 0.11111 | The movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and the nicest thing I can say is that I ca n't remember a single name responsible for it .
188433 | 0.58333 | The movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors ' moments .
188434 | 0.375 | The movie is genial but never inspired , and little about it will stay with you .
188435 | 0.33333 | The movie is like Scorsese 's Mean Streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old ` juvenile delinquent ' paperbacks with titles like Leather Warriors and Switchblade Sexpot .
188440 | 0.34722 | The movie is n't painfully bad , something to be ` fully experienced ' ; it 's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten .
188445 | 0.125 | The movie is silly beyond comprehension , and even if it were n't silly , it would still be beyond comprehension .
188446 | 0.18056 | The movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue , just because it seems obligatory .
188447 | 0.055556 | The movie is the equivalent of French hip-hop , which also seems to play on a 10-year delay .
188448 | 0.20833 | The movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications .
188449 | 0.30556 | The movie is too impressed with its own solemn insights to work up much entertainment value .
188451 | 0.375 | The movie itself appears to be running on hypertime in reverse as the truly funny bits get further and further apart .
188452 | 0.18056 | The movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates .
188454 | 0.43056 | The movie strains to stay on the light , comic side of the issue , despite the difficulty of doing so when dealing with the destruction of property and , potentially , of life itself .
188455 | 0.125 | The movie suffers from two fatal ailments -- a dearth of vitality and a story that 's shapeless and uninflected .
188456 | 0.51389 | The movie tries to be ethereal , but ends up seeming goofy .
188458 | 0.31944 | The movie wavers between Hallmark card sentimentality and goofy , life-affirming moments straight out of a cellular phone commercial .
188460 | 0.625 | The mushy finale turns John Q into a movie-of-the-week tearjerker .
188473 | 0.26389 | The narrator and the other characters try to convince us that acting transfigures Esther , but she 's never seen speaking on stage ; one feels cheated , and Esther seems to remain an unchanged dullard .
188476 | 0.48611 | The niftiest trick perpetrated by The Importance of Being Earnest is the alchemical transmogrification of Wilde into Austen -- and a Hollywood-ized Austen at that .
188478 | 0.16667 | The nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations .
188482 | 0.5 | The obligatory break-ups and hook-ups do n't seem to have much emotional impact on the characters .
188486 | 0.097222 | The obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old Hanna-Barbera charm .
188491 | 0.125 | The only problem is that , by the end , no one in the audience or the film seems to really care .
188494 | 0.22222 | The only reason you should see this movie is if you have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow .
188497 | 0.38889 | The only type of lives this glossy comedy-drama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies .
188500 | 0.41667 | The only upside to all of this unpleasantness is , given its Labor Day weekend upload , FearDotCom should log a minimal number of hits .
188503 | 0.34722 | The only young people who possibly will enjoy it are infants ... who might be distracted by the movie 's quick movements and sounds .
188508 | 0.56944 | The origin story is well told , and the characters will not disappoint anyone who values the original comic books .
188520 | 0.13889 | The pacing is deadly , the narration helps little and Naipaul , a juicy writer , is negated .
188524 | 0.19444 | The pacing is often way off and there are too many bona fide groaners among too few laughs .
188530 | 0.25 | The pairing does sound promising in theory ... but their lack of chemistry makes Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro in Showtime look like old , familiar vaudeville partners .
188532 | 0.48611 | The people in ABC Africa are treated as docile , mostly wordless ethnographic extras .

188535 | 0.069444 | The picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment .
188536 | 0.34722 | The picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male All About Eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the Intermezzo strain .
188538 | 0.44444 | The plot 's clearly mythic structure may owe more to Disney 's strong sense of formula than to the original story .
188543 | 0.25 | The plot 's contrivances are uncomfortably strained .

188572 | 0.18056 | The problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull .
188574 | 0.33333 | The problem with The Bread , My Sweet is that it 's far too sentimental .
188576 | 0.27778 | The problem with all of this : It 's not really funny .
188584 | 0.30556 | The problem with the mayhem in Formula 51 is not that it 's offensive , but that it 's boring .
188588 | 0.27778 | The problematic characters and overly convenient plot twists foul up Shum 's good intentions .
188593 | 0.16667 | The project 's filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger Fatal Attraction into a high school setting .
188596 | 0.375 | The punch lines that miss , unfortunately , outnumber the hits by three-to-one .
188608 | 0.33333 | The redeeming feature of Chan 's films has always been the action , but the stunts in The Tuxedo seem tired and , what 's worse , routine .
188610 | 0.27778 | The result is an ` action film ' mired in stasis .
188611 | 0.47222 | The result is good gossip , entertainingly delivered , yet with a distinctly musty odour , its expiry date long gone .
188612 | 0.25 | The result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel .
188614 | 0.26389 | The rollerball sequences feel sanitised and stagey .
188617 | 0.36111 | The romance between the leads is n't as compelling or as believable as it should be .
188619 | 0.59722 | The same should go for movie theaters .
188621 | 0.29167 | The satire is just too easy to be genuinely satisfying .
188622 | 0.15278 | The satire is unfocused , while the story goes nowhere .
188626 | 0.27778 | The screenplay , co-written by director Imogen Kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing .
188627 | 0.43056 | The screenplay comes across , rather unintentionally , as Hip-Hop Scooby-Doo .
188628 | 0.29167 | The screenplay flounders under the weight of too many story lines .
188629 | 0.375 | The screenplay is hugely overwritten , with tons and tons of dialogue -- most of it given to children .

188802 | 0.38889 | There 's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film 's simple title .

188975 | 0.27778 | This is Sandler running on empty , repeating what he 's already done way too often .
188978 | 0.16667 | This is a fragmented film , once a good idea that was followed by the bad idea to turn it into a movie .
188982 | 0.34722 | This is a heartfelt story ... it just is n't a very involving one .
188983 | 0.34722 | This is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy .
188985 | 0.18056 | This is a movie filled with unlikable , spiteful idiots ; whether or not their friendship is salvaged makes no difference in the least .
188986 | 0.22222 | This is a movie that starts out like Heathers , then becomes Bring it On , then becomes unwatchable .
188990 | 0.40278 | This is a picture that Maik , the firebrand turned savvy ad man , would be envious of : it hijacks the heat of revolution and turns it into a sales tool .
188991 | 0.33333 | This is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like Them !
188992 | 0.33333 | This is a third-person story now , told by Hollywood , and much more ordinary for it .
188994 | 0.29167 | This is an action movie with an action icon who 's been all but decommissioned .
188995 | 0.29167 | This is an exercise not in biography but in hero worship .
188996 | 0.20833 | This is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors .
188997 | 0.20833 | This is as lax and limp a comedy as I 've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material .
188998 | 0.22222 | This is cruel , misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy .
188999 | 0.20833 | This is for the most part a useless movie , even with a great director at the helm .
189001 | 0.55556 | This is mild-mannered , been-there material given a pedestrian spin by a director who needed a touch of the flamboyant , the outrageous .
189007 | 0.27778 | This is n't a movie ; it 's a symptom .
189012 | 0.51389 | This is n't a terrible film by any means , but it 's also far from being a realized work .
189014 | 0.38889 | This is not a Jackie Chan movie .

189027 | 0.19444 | This is surely one of the most frantic , virulent and foul-natured Christmas season pics ever delivered by a Hollywood studio .
189028 | 0.58333 | This is the first film I 've ever seen that had no obvious directing involved .

189037 | 0.26389 | This is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives .
189039 | 0.027778 | This kiddie-oriented stinker is so bad that I even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater
189042 | 0.25 | This latest installment of the horror film franchise that is apparently as invulnerable as its trademark villain has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff , demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent , well-made B movie is long gone .
189044 | 0.11111 | This little film is so slovenly done , so primitive in technique , that it ca n't really be called animation .
189047 | 0.23611 | This low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the Farrelly brothers ' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time .
189049 | 0.18056 | This ludicrous film is predictable at every turn .
189050 | 0.30556 | This may be the first cartoon ever to look as if it were being shown on the projection television screen of a sports bar .

189073 | 0.16667 | This picture is murder by numbers , and as easy to be bored by as your ABC 's , despite a few whopping shootouts .
189075 | 0.33333 | This rather unfocused , all-over-the-map movie would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens ... or if it were subtler ... or if it had a sense of humor .

189129 | 0.30556 | Though Tom Shadyac 's film kicks off spookily enough , around the halfway mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance .
189131 | 0.43056 | Though excessively tiresome , The Uncertainty Principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore .
189135 | 0.26389 | Though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it 's exploitive without being insightful .
189137 | 0.44444 | Though it was made with careful attention to detail and is well-acted by James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal , I felt disrespected .
189139 | 0.72222 | Though its rather routine script is loaded with familiar situations , the movie has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should .
189141 | 0.625 | Though the film is static , its writer-director 's heart is in the right place , his plea for democracy and civic action laudable .
189143 | 0.31944 | Though there 's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film 's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish .
189145 | 0.30556 | Though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie 's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker 's flailing reputation .
189147 | 0.30556 | Though there are many tense scenes in Trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful .
189158 | 0.40278 | Thriller directorial debut for Traffic scribe Gaghan has all the right parts , but the pieces do n't quite fit together .

189185 | 0.083333 | To say that this vapid vehicle is downright doltish and uneventful is just as obvious as telling a country skunk that he has severe body odor .
189192 | 0.22222 | To the filmmakers , Ivan is a prince of a fellow , but he comes across as shallow and glib though not mean-spirited , and there 's no indication that he 's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit .
189194 | 0.375 | To the vast majority of more casual filmgoers , it will probably be a talky bore .
189202 | 0.29167 | Told in scattered fashion , the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject .
189207 | 0.43056 | Tom Green and an Ivy League college should never appear together on a marquee , especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like Stealing Harvard , which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 .

222750 | 0.40278 | But his showboating wise-cracker stock persona sure is getting old .
222751 | 0.22222 | But how it washed out despite all of that is the project 's prime mystery .
222752 | 0.15278 | But if the essence of magic is its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm , this is the opposite of a truly magical movie .

222754 | 0.47222 | But if you expect light romantic comedy , good gosh , will you be shocked .
222755 | 0.48611 | But in 2002 , such revelations wilt .
222759 | 0.33333 | But it 's also disappointing to a certain degree .
222760 | 0.73611 | But it 's defiantly and delightfully against the grain .
222761 | 0.68056 | But it 's emotionally engrossing , too , thanks to strong , credible performances from the whole cast .
222762 | 0.125 | But it 's hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre .
222763 | 0.30556 | But it 's hardly a necessary enterprise .
222764 | 0.63889 | But it 's surprisingly harmless .
222765 | 0.18056 | But it 's too long and too convoluted and it ends in a muddle .
222766 | 0.72222 | But it 's worth the concentration .
222767 | 0.22222 | But it also comes with the laziness and arrogance of a thing that already knows it 's won .
222768 | 0.70833 | But it also has many of the things that made the first one charming .
222769 | 0.75 | But it could be , by its art and heart , a necessary one .
222770 | 0.36111 | But it could have been worse .

222775 | 0.65278 | But it is entertaining on an inferior level .
222776 | 0.55556 | But it is set in a world that is very , very far from the one most of us inhabit .
222777 | 0.61111 | But it still jingles in the pocket .
222778 | 0.27778 | But it was n't .

222780 | 0.33333 | But it would be better to wait for the video .
222781 | 0.43056 | But its awkward structure keeps breaking the spell .
222782 | 0.26389 | But its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless .
222783 | 0.097222 | But like Bruce Springsteen 's gone-to-pot Asbury Park , New Jersey , this sad-sack waste of a movie is a City of ruins .
222784 | 0.27778 | But like most rabbits , it seems to lack substance .
222785 | 0.23611 | But mainstream audiences will find little of interest in this film , which is often preachy and poorly acted .
222786 | 0.83333 | But mostly it 's a work that , with humor , warmth , and intelligence , captures a life interestingly lived .
222787 | 0.63889 | But never mind all that ; the boobs are fantasti
222788 | 0.38889 | But no. .

222792 | 0.625 | But once the falcon arrives in the skies above Manhattan , the adventure is on red alert .
222796 | 0.097222 | But one thing 's for sure : It never comes close to being either funny or scary .
222797 | 0.26389 | But seriously , folks , it does n't work .
222801 | 0.375 | But that 's just the problem with it - the director has n't added enough of his own ingredients .
222802 | 0.70833 | But that they are doing it is thought-provoking .
222803 | 0.19444 | But the 2002 film does n't really believe in it , and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate ` comedy ' scenes .
222804 | 0.72222 | But the actors make this worth a peek .
222805 | 0.26389 | But the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored .
222806 | 0.22222 | But the cinematography is cloudy , the picture making becalmed .
222807 | 0.40278 | But the execution is a flop with the exception of about six gags that really work .
222808 | 0.33333 | But the feelings evoked in the film are lukewarm and quick to pass .
222809 | 0.16667 | But the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging .
222810 | 0.22222 | But the movie 's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure .
222811 | 0.19444 | But the movie that does n't really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences
222812 | 0.84722 | But the nerve-raked acting , the crackle of lines , the impressive stagings of hardware , make for some robust and scary entertainment .
222813 | 0.83333 | But the performances of Pacino , Williams , and Swank keep the viewer wide-awake all the way through .
222814 | 0.30556 | But the problem with Wendigo , for all its effective moments , is n't really one of resources .
222815 | 0.19444 | But the second half of the movie really goes downhill .
222816 | 0.91667 | But the talented cast alone will keep you watching , as will the fight scenes .
222817 | 0.23611 | But then again , I hate myself most mornings .
222818 | 0.29167 | But there 's plenty to offend everyone ...
222819 | 0.23611 | But they do n't fit well together and neither is well told .
222820 | 0.61111 | But they fascinate in their recklessness .
222821 | 0.31944 | But they lack their idol 's energy and passion for detail .
222822 | 0.097222 | But this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film .
222823 | 0.30556 | But this films lacks the passion required to sell the material .
222824 | 0.5 | But this is Lohman 's film .
222825 | 0.16667 | But this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title .
222826 | 0.29167 | But this time , the old MIB label stands for Milder Is n't Better .
222827 | 0.72222 | But though he only scratches the surface , at least he provides a strong itch to explore more .
222828 | 0.16667 | But ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as Mr. De Niro .
222829 | 0.68056 | But tongue-in-cheek preposterousness has always been part of For the most part Wilde 's droll whimsy helps `` Being Earnest '' overcome its weaknesses and Parker 's creative interference ...
222830 | 0.29167 | But unless you 're an absolute raving Star Wars junkie , it is n't much fun .
222831 | 0.90278 | But what 's nice is that there 's a casual intelligence that permeates the script .
222833 | 0.54167 | But what about the countless other people who 'd merely like to watch a solid tale about a universally interesting soul ?
222834 | 0.38889 | But what are adults doing in the theater at all ?

222839 | 0.84722 | But while the highly predictable narrative falls short , Treasure Planet is truly gorgeous to behold .
222840 | 0.45833 | But you 'd never guess that from the performances .
222848 | 0.79167 | By and large this is Mr. Kilmer 's movie , and it 's his strongest performance since The Doors .
222849 | 0.069444 | By that measure , it is a failure .

223970 | 0.38889 | If you are willing to do this , then you so crazy !
223972 | 0.75 | If you can get past the fantastical aspects and harsh realities of `` The Isle '' you 'll get a sock-you-in-the-eye flick that is a visual tour-de-force and a story that is unlike any you will likely see anywhere else .

223988 | 0.77778 | If you open yourself up to Mr. Reggio 's theory of this imagery as the movie 's set ... it can impart an almost visceral sense of dislocation and change .
223990 | 0.27778 | Ignore the reputation , and ignore the film .
223992 | 0.26389 | Ill-considered , unholy hokum .
223993 | 0.097222 | Imagine Kevin Smith , the blasphemous bad boy of suburban Jersey , if he were stripped of most of his budget and all of his sense of humor .
223995 | 0.18056 | Imagine O. Henry 's The Gift of the Magi relocated to the scuzzy underbelly of NYC 's drug scene .

224004 | 0.40278 | In a 102-minute film , Aaliyah gets at most 20 minutes of screen time .
224005 | 0.19444 | In a normal screen process , these bromides would be barely enough to sustain an interstitial program on the Discovery Channel .
224007 | 0.5 | In a word -- yes .
224008 | 0.44444 | In a word : No. .
224009 | 0.055556 | In addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , Ballistic : Ecks Vs. Sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase .
224010 | 0.68056 | In an ART FILM !
224011 | 0.38889 | In any case , I would recommend Big Bad Love only to Winger fans who have missed her since 1995 's Forget Paris .
224012 | 0.31944 | In between all the emotional seesawing , it 's hard to figure the depth of these two literary figures , and even the times in which they lived .

224015 | 0.76389 | In fact , it 's quite fun in places .

224019 | 0.83333 | In his debut as a director , Washington has a sure hand .
224020 | 0.43056 | In his first stab at the form , Jacquot takes a slightly anarchic approach that works only sporadically .
224021 | 0.72222 | In its own floundering way , it gets to you .
224025 | 0.30556 | In old-fashioned screenwriting parlance , Ms. Shreve 's novel proved too difficult a text to ` lick , ' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast .
224026 | 0.25 | In one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of Quentin Tarantino 's climactic shootout -- and Meat Loaf explodes .
224028 | 0.069444 | In other words , about as bad a film you 're likely to see all year .
224029 | 0.083333 | In other words , it 's badder than bad .
224030 | 0.31944 | In other words , it 's just another sports drama\/character study .
224031 | 0.51389 | In some ways , Lagaan is quintessential Bollywood .
224032 | 0.18056 | In that setting , their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting .
224034 | 0.30556 | In the book-on-tape market , the film of `` The Kid Stays in the Picture '' would be an abridged edition
224035 | 0.30556 | In the end , Punch-Drunk Love is one of those films that I wanted to like much more than I actually did .
224036 | 0.47222 | In the end , White Oleander is n't an adaptation of a novel .
224037 | 0.52778 | In the end , though , it is only mildly amusing when it could have been so much more .
224038 | 0.33333 | In the not-too-distant future , movies like Ghost Ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds .

224065 | 0.23611 | Instead , we just get messy anger , a movie as personal therapy .
224066 | 0.38889 | Instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story , the film 's more determined to become the next Texas Chainsaw Massacre .
224067 | 0.27778 | Instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , Hart 's War , like the St. Louis Rams in the Super Bowl , waits until after halftime to get started .

224093 | 0.36111 | Is it a comedy ?
224095 | 0.52778 | Is it something any true film addict will want to check out ?
224099 | 0.125 | Is there a group of more self-absorbed women than the mother and daughters featured in this film ?
224102 | 0.40278 | Is this love or is it masochism ?
224103 | 0.38889 | Is this progress ?
224106 | 0.5 | Is truth stranger than fiction ?
224107 | 0.52778 | It 's 51 times better than this .
224108 | 0.055556 | It 's Pauly Shore awful .
224115 | 0.11111 | It 's a bad sign when you 're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects ' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it 's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .
224116 | 0.72222 | It 's a beautiful madness .
224118 | 0.56944 | It 's a brilliant , honest performance by Nicholson , but the film is an agonizing bore except when the fantastic Kathy Bates turns up .
224119 | 0.80556 | It 's a cool event for the whole family .
224120 | 0.55556 | It 's a fanboy ` what if ? '
224121 | 0.5 | It 's a feature-length adaptation of one of those `` Can This Marriage Be Saved ? ''
224122 | 0.86111 | It 's a funny little movie with clever dialogue and likeable characters .
224123 | 0.80556 | It 's a glorious spectacle like those D.W. Griffith made in the early days of silent film .
224124 | 0.80556 | It 's a great performance and a reminder of Dickens ' grandeur .
224125 | 0.98611 | It 's a masterpeice .
224126 | 0.25 | It 's a movie that ends with Truckzilla , for cryin ' out loud .
224127 | 0.66667 | It 's a quirky , off-beat project .
224131 | 0.45833 | It 's a scathing portrayal .
224132 | 0.625 | It 's a sly wink to The Others without becoming a postmodern joke , made creepy by its `` men in a sardine can '' warped logic .
224133 | 0.94444 | It 's a smart , solid , kinetically-charged spy flick worthy of a couple hours of summertime and a bucket of popcorn .
224134 | 0.69444 | It 's a spectacular performance - ahem , we hope it 's only acting .
224135 | 0.16667 | It 's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish .
224136 | 0.68056 | It 's a testament to the film 's considerable charm that it succeeds in entertaining , despite playing out like a feature-length sitcom replete with stereotypical familial quandaries .
224140 | 0.90278 | It 's a treat -- a delightful , witty , improbable romantic comedy with a zippy jazzy score ... Grant and Bullock make it look as though they are having so much fun .
224143 | 0.18056 | It 's a visual Rorschach test and I must have failed .
224144 | 0.66667 | It 's about following your dreams , no matter what your parents think .
224145 | 0.77778 | It 's absolutely amazing how first-time director Kevin Donovan managed to find something new to add to the canon of Chan .
224150 | 0.19444 | It 's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are ` edgy . '
224151 | 0.20833 | It 's also stupider .
224152 | 0.84722 | It 's also the year 's sweetest movie .
224153 | 0.13889 | It 's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic .
224160 | 0.70833 | It 's an effort to watch this movie , but it eventually pays off and is effective if you stick with it .
224161 | 0.48611 | It 's another retelling of Alexandre Dumas ' classic .
224163 | 0.20833 | It 's as if Solondz had two ideas for two movies , could n't really figure out how to flesh either out , so he just slopped ` em together here .
224164 | 0.125 | It 's as if a bored Cage spent the duration of the film 's shooting schedule waiting to scream : `` Got AIDS yet ? ''
224165 | 0.48611 | It 's been 20 years since 48 Hrs .
224166 | 0.81944 | It 's been done before but never so vividly or with so much passion .
224167 | 0.51389 | It 's dark and tragic , and lets the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death
224168 | 0.29167 | It 's drab .
224169 | 0.65278 | It 's endearing to hear Madame D. refer to her husband as ` Jackie ' -- and he does make for excellent company , not least as a self-conscious performer .
224173 | 0.73611 | It 's far from a frothy piece , and the characters are complex , laden with plenty of baggage and tinged with tragic undertones .
224175 | 0.625 | It 's fun , but it 's a real howler .
224176 | 0.72222 | It 's funny .
224177 | 0.22222 | It 's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that Hollywood is n't laughing with us , folks .
224178 | 0.5 | It 's hard to fairly judge a film like RINGU when you 've seen the remake first .
224179 | 0.11111 | It 's hard to imagine acting that could be any flatter .
224184 | 0.68056 | It 's hard to imagine anybody ever being `` in the mood '' to view a movie as harrowing and painful as The Grey Zone , but it 's equally hard to imagine anybody being able to tear their eyes away from the screen once it 's started .
224185 | 0.27778 | It 's hard to pity the ` plain ' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss .
224187 | 0.66667 | It 's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles , but Notorious C.H.O. still feels like a promising work-in-progress .
224189 | 0.26389 | It 's hard to say who might enjoy this , are there Tolstoy groupies out there ?
224190 | 0.66667 | It 's incredible the number of stories the Holocaust has generated .
224191 | 0.33333 | It 's just a movie that happens to have Jackie Chan in it .
224192 | 0.25 | It 's just filler .
224193 | 0.055556 | It 's just merely very bad .
224194 | 0.22222 | It 's just that it 's so not-at-all-good .
224195 | 0.34722 | It 's laughing at us .
224197 | 0.45833 | It 's like a `` Big Chill '' reunion of the Baader-Meinhof Gang , only these guys are more harmless pranksters than political activists .
224201 | 0.44444 | It 's like an old Warner Bros. costumer jived with sex -- this could be the movie Errol Flynn always wanted to make , though Bette Davis , cast as Joan , would have killed him .
224202 | 0.34722 | It 's like going to a house party and watching the host defend himself against a frothing ex-girlfriend .
224203 | 0.58333 | It 's likely that whatever you thought of the first production -- pro or con -- you 'll likely think of this one .
224211 | 0.15278 | It 's not a motion picture ; it 's an utterly static picture .
224212 | 0.38889 | It 's not an easy one to review .
224213 | 0.68056 | It 's not just a feel-good movie , it 's a feel movie .
224218 | 0.56944 | It 's not life-affirming -- its vulgar and mean , but I liked it .
224219 | 0.58333 | It 's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie .
224220 | 0.68056 | It 's not too fast and not too slow .
224223 | 0.59722 | It 's not too racy and it 's not too offensive .
224224 | 0.33333 | It 's one thing to read about or rail against the ongoing - and unprecedented - construction project going on over our heads .
224229 | 0.91667 | It 's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message , so it 's great for the kids .
224230 | 0.055556 | It 's petty thievery like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars
224232 | 0.38889 | It 's plotless , shapeless -- and yet , it must be admitted , not entirely humorless .
224233 | 0.70833 | It 's probably worth catching solely on its visual merits .
224234 | 0.58333 | It 's quite another to feel physically caught up in the process .
224235 | 0.25 | It 's rare to see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from `` promising '' to `` interesting '' to `` familiar '' before landing squarely on `` stupid '' .
224237 | 0.13889 | It 's slow -- very , very slow .
224238 | 0.79167 | It 's so good that its relentless , polished wit can withstand not only inept school productions , but even Oliver Parker 's movie adaptation .
224242 | 0.66667 | It 's sort of in-between , and it works .
224244 | 0.45833 | It 's still Adam Sandler , and it 's not Little Nicky .
224245 | 0.083333 | It 's still terrible !
224246 | 0.125 | It 's super - violent , super-serious and super-stupid .
224247 | 0.70833 | It 's sweet .
224251 | 0.31944 | It 's sweet and fluffy at the time , but it may leave you feeling a little sticky and unsatisfied .
224252 | 0 | It 's that painful .
224253 | 0.875 | It 's the chemistry between the women and the droll scene-stealing wit and wolfish pessimism of Anna Chancellor that makes this `` Two Weddings and a Funeral '' fun .
224255 | 0.58333 | It 's the perfect kind of film to see when you do n't want to use your brain .
224256 | 0.77778 | It 's the sweet Cinderella story that `` Pretty Woman '' wanted to be .
224257 | 0.59722 | It 's time to let your hair down -- Greek style .
224258 | 0.34722 | It 's too bad that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one .
224263 | 0.625 | It 's too harsh to work as a piece of storytelling , but as an intellectual exercise -- an unpleasant debate that 's been given the drive of a narrative and that 's been acted out -- The Believer is nothing less than a provocative piece of work .
224264 | 0.79167 | It 's touching and tender and proves that even in sorrow you can find humor .
224265 | 0.13889 | It 's uninteresting .
224266 | 0.54167 | It 's unnerving to see Recoing 's bizzarre reaction to his unemployment .
224268 | 0.625 | It 's usually a bad sign when directors abandon their scripts and go where the moment takes them , but Olympia , Wash. , based filmmakers Anne de Marcken and Marilyn Freeman did just that and it 's what makes their project so interesting .
224269 | 0.31944 | It all comes down to whether you can tolerate Leon Barlow .
224270 | 0.56944 | It bites hard .
224273 | 0.55556 | It ca n't escape its past , and it does n't want to .
224274 | 0.041667 | It can not be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull .
224275 | 0.25 | It collapses when Mr. Taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller 's rush .
224276 | 0.81944 | It cuts to the core of what it actually means to face your fears , to be a girl in a world of boys , to be a boy truly in love with a girl , and to ride the big metaphorical wave that is life -- wherever it takes you .
224277 | 0.45833 | It did n't go straight to video .
224278 | 0.5 | It does give you a peek .
224282 | 0.15278 | It does n't believe in itself , it has no sense of humor ... it 's just plain bored .
224285 | 0.52778 | It does n't quite deserve the gong , but there are more fascinating acts than `` Confessions of a Dangerous Mind . ''
224289 | 0.61111 | It does n't reach them , but the effort is gratefully received .
224290 | 0.25 | It does n't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events .
224291 | 0.70833 | It does succeed by following a feel-good formula with a winning style , and by offering its target audience of urban kids some welcome role models and optimism .
224296 | 0.72222 | It falls far short of poetry , but it 's not bad prose .
224298 | 0.44444 | It follows the basic plot trajectory of nearly every Schwarzenegger film : Someone crosses Arnie .
224301 | 0.33333 | It forces you to watch people doing unpleasant things to each other and themselves , and it maintains a cool distance from its material that is deliberately unsettling .
224302 | 0.20833 | It gets old quickly .
224305 | 0.34722 | It gives poor Dana Carvey nothing to do that is really funny , and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time .
224308 | 0.81944 | It has fun with the quirks of family life , but it also treats the subject with fondness and respect .
224312 | 0.25 | It has no affect on the Kurds , but it wore me down .
224313 | 0.75 | It has plenty of laughs .
224315 | 0.81944 | It haunts , horrifies , startles and fascinates ; it is impossible to look away .
224321 | 0.22222 | It irritates and saddens me that Martin Lawrence 's latest vehicle can explode obnoxiously into 2,500 screens while something of Bubba Ho-Tep 's clearly evident quality may end up languishing on a shelf somewhere .
224326 | 0.83333 | It is , however , a completely honest , open-hearted film that should appeal to anyone willing to succumb to it .
224327 | 0.875 | It is a kickass , dense sci-fi action thriller hybrid that delivers and then some .
224328 | 0.59722 | It is a movie about passion .
224329 | 0.30556 | It is a popcorn film , not a must-own , or even a must-see .
224332 | 0.63889 | It is about irrational , unexplainable life and it seems so real because it does not attempt to filter out the complexity .
224333 | 0.18056 | It is n't quite one of the worst movies of the year .
224334 | 0.36111 | It is n't scary .
224335 | 0.18056 | It is n't that Stealing Harvard is a horrible movie -- if only it were that grand a failure !
224336 | 0.5 | It is nature against progress .
224337 | 0.55556 | It is not what you see , it is what you think you see .
224341 | 0.055556 | It is supremely unfunny and unentertaining to watch middle-age and older men drink to excess , piss on trees , b.s. one another and put on a show in drag .
224342 | 0.33333 | It is too bad that this likable movie is n't more accomplished .
224343 | 0.38889 | It just does n't have anything really interesting to say .
224344 | 0.43056 | It just does n't have much else ... especially in a moral sense .
224345 | 0.34722 | It labours as storytelling .
224357 | 0.11111 | It made me feel unclean , and I 'm the guy who liked There 's Something About Mary and both American Pie movies .
224358 | 0.23611 | It makes me feel weird \/ Thinking about all the bad things in the world \/ Like puppies with broken legs \/ And butterflies that die \/ And movies starring pop queens
224359 | 0.055556 | It makes me say the obvious : Abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here .
224363 | 0.19444 | It may as well be called `` Jar-Jar Binks : The Movie . ''
224364 | 0.48611 | It may even fall into the category of Films You Love to Hate .
224365 | 0.44444 | It may not be `` Last Tango in Paris '' but ...
224367 | 0.75 | It may not be a huge cut of above the rest , but I enjoyed Barbershop .
224368 | 0.55556 | It may not be as cutting , as witty or as true as back in the glory days of Weekend and Two or Three Things I Know About Her , but who else engaged in filmmaking today is so cognizant of the cultural and moral issues involved in the process ?
224369 | 0.52778 | It may not be history -- but then again , what if it is ?
224374 | 0.75 | It may scream low budget , but this charmer has a spirit that can not be denied .
224375 | 0.30556 | It might as well have been Problem Child IV .
224380 | 0.79167 | It might be tempting to regard Mr. Andrew and his collaborators as oddballs , but Mr. Earnhart 's quizzical , charming movie allows us to see them , finally , as artists .
224381 | 0.5 | It must be in the genes .
224382 | 0.44444 | It never is , not fully .
224383 | 0.22222 | It never plays as dramatic even when dramatic things happen to people .
224384 | 0.29167 | It plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its `` dead wife communicating from beyond the grave '' framework is even remotely new or interesting .
224385 | 0.5 | It provides a grim , upsetting glimpse at the lives of some of the 1.2 million Palestinians who live in the crowded cities and refugee camps of Gaza .
224386 | 0.61111 | It puts Washington , as honest working man John Q. Archibald , on a pedestal , then keeps lifting the pedestal higher .
224387 | 0.66667 | It really is a shame that more wo n't get an opportunity to embrace small , sweet ` Evelyn . '

224410 | 0.77778 | Its flame-like , roiling black-and-white inspires trembling and gratitude .
224411 | 0.38889 | Its gross-out gags and colorful set pieces ... are of course stultifyingly contrived and too stylized by half .
224414 | 0.23611 | Its mysteries are transparently obvious , and it 's too slowly paced to be a thriller .
224418 | 0.29167 | Its one-sidedness ... flirts with propaganda .
224421 | 0.069444 | Its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question : Since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb ?
224428 | 0.625 | J. Lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie , although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear : She 's a pretty woman , but she 's no working girl .

224895 | 0.19444 | Mr. Deeds is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of not-so-funny gags , scattered moments of lazy humor .
224896 | 0.83333 | Mr. Deeds is sure to give you a lot of laughs in this simple , sweet and romantic comedy .
224912 | 0.16667 | Mr. Goyer 's loose , unaccountable direction is technically sophisticated in the worst way .
224930 | 0.83333 | Mr. Koshashvili is a director to watch .
224949 | 0.93056 | Mr. Parker has brilliantly updated his source and grasped its essence , composing a sorrowful and hilarious tone poem about alienated labor , or an absurdist workplace sitcom .
224957 | 0.72222 | Mr. Polanski is in his element here : alone , abandoned , but still consoled by his art , which is more than he has ever revealed before about the source of his spiritual survival .
224974 | 0.77778 | Mr. Scorsese 's bravery and integrity in advancing this vision can hardly be underestimated .
224982 | 0.18056 | Mr. Soderbergh 's direction and visual style struck me as unusually and unimpressively fussy and pretentious .

225023 | 0.84722 | Ms. Hutchins is talented enough and charismatic enough to make us care about Zelda 's ultimate fate .
225031 | 0.11111 | Ms. Phoenix is completely lacking in charm and charisma , and is unable to project either Esther 's initial anomie or her eventual awakening .
225043 | 0.80556 | Ms. Seigner and Mr. Serrault bring fresh , unforced naturalism to their characters .
225056 | 0.83333 | Much of it comes from the brave , uninhibited performances by its lead actors .
225060 | 0.76389 | Much of it is funny , but there are also some startling , surrealistic moments ...
225061 | 0.73611 | Much of the movie 's charm lies in the utter cuteness of Stuart and Margolo .
225062 | 0.81944 | Much of the way , though , this is a refreshingly novel ride .

225112 | 0.65278 | Never once predictable .
225113 | 0.22222 | Nevertheless , it still seems endless .
225123 | 0.44444 | Newcomer helmer Kevin Donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept -- a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman .
225128 | 0.88889 | Nicholson 's understated performance is wonderful .
225135 | 0.77778 | Nicole Holofcenter , the insightful writer\/director responsible for this illuminating comedy does n't wrap the proceedings up neatly but the ideas tie together beautifully .

225141 | 0.70833 | No , I love it ... hell , I dunno .
225142 | 0.30556 | No , even that 's too committed .
225148 | 0.069444 | No , it 's the repetition of said behavior , and so Children of the Century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else .
225152 | 0.055556 | No French people were harmed during the making of this movie , but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half .
225154 | 0.94444 | No Such Thing is sort of a minimalist Beauty and the Beast , but in this case the Beast should definitely get top billing .
225155 | 0.375 | No aspirations to social import inform the movie version .
225158 | 0.30556 | No better or worse than ` Truth or Consequences , N.M. ' or any other interchangeable actioner with imbecilic Mafia toolbags botching a routine assignment in a Western backwater .

225161 | 0.25 | No laughs .

225176 | 0.097222 | Nonsensical , dull `` cyber-horror '' flick is a grim , hollow exercise in flat scares and bad acting .
225177 | 0.44444 | Nor is it a romantic comedy .

225196 | 0.34722 | Not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general .
225197 | 0.25 | Not just unlikable .
225200 | 0.5 | Not kids , who do n't need the lesson in repugnance .
225201 | 0.47222 | Not nearly long enough .
225202 | 0.83333 | Not only are the special effects and narrative flow much improved , and Daniel Radcliffe more emotionally assertive this time around as Harry , but the film conjures the magic of author J.K. Rowling 's books .
225203 | 0.083333 | Not only is entry number twenty the worst of the Brosnan bunch , it 's one of the worst of the entire franchise .
225206 | 0.33333 | Not so much a movie as a picture book for the big screen .

225234 | 0.73611 | Notwithstanding my problem with the movie 's final half hour , I 'm going to recommend SECRETARY , based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by Spader and Gyllenhaal , and also the unique way Shainberg goes about telling what at heart is a sweet little girl -

226253 | 0.16667 | The film 's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency .
226256 | 0.16667 | The film 's lack of personality permeates all its aspects -- from the TV movie-esque , affected child acting to the dullest Irish pub scenes ever filmed .

226267 | 0.63889 | The film has a laundry list of minor shortcomings , but the numerous scenes of gory mayhem are worth the price of admission ... if `` gory mayhem '' is your idea of a good time .
226268 | 0.625 | The film is a fierce dance of destruction .
226270 | 0.27778 | The film is an earnest try at beachcombing verismo , but it would be even more indistinct than it is were it not for the striking , quietly vulnerable personality of Ms. Ambrose .
226271 | 0.5 | The film is directed by Wally Wolodarsky from a script by Joe Jarvis and Greg Coolidge .
226275 | 0.54167 | The film is explosive , but a few of those sticks are wet .
226280 | 0.77778 | The film is faithful to what one presumes are the book 's twin premises -- that we become who we are on the backs of our parents , but we have no idea who they were at our age ; and that time is a fleeting and precious commodity no matter how old you are .
226281 | 0.13889 | The film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in Chinese history : war , revolution , Communism , etc. .
226282 | 0.77778 | The film reminds me of a vastly improved Germanic version of My Big Fat Greek Wedding -- with better characters , some genuine quirkiness and at least a measure of style .
226283 | 0.26389 | The film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip .
226284 | 0.15278 | The film would work much better as a video installation in a museum , where viewers would be free to leave .
226286 | 0.25 | The filmmakers are playing to the Big Boys in New York and L.A. To that end , they mock the kind of folks they do n't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers do n't care to understand , either .
226287 | 0.15278 | The first Fatal Attraction was vile enough .

226323 | 0.73611 | The long-range appeal of `` Minority Report '' should transcend any awards it bags .
226325 | 0.47222 | The main problem being that it 's only a peek .
226326 | 0.19444 | The makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep .
226327 | 0.33333 | The mantra behind the project seems to have been ` it 's just a kids ' flick . '
226329 | 0.51389 | The messages of compassion and mercy are clearly , squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated Old Testament tale of Jonah and the Whale .

226337 | 0.13889 | The most memorable moment was when Green threw medical equipment at a window ; not because it was particularly funny , but because I had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle 's walker and toss it at the screen in frustration .
226342 | 0.20833 | The movie 's downfall is to substitute plot for personality .
226350 | 0.69444 | The movie 's seams may show ... but Pellington gives `` Mothman '' an irresistibly uncanny ambience that goes a long way toward keeping the picture compelling .
226351 | 0.34722 | The movie 's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story .
226360 | 0.80556 | The movie has lots of dancing and fabulous music .
226361 | 0.013889 | The movie is a dud .
226362 | 0.33333 | The movie is about as deep as that sentiment .
226364 | 0.625 | The movie is hardly a masterpiece , but it does mark Ms. Bullock 's best work in some time .
226365 | 0.83333 | The movie is ingenious fun .
226366 | 0.375 | The movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the `` webcast . ''
226370 | 0.43056 | The movie is n't horrible , but you can see mediocre cresting on the next wave .
226371 | 0.43056 | The movie is obviously a labour of love so Howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted .
226372 | 0.15278 | The movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical .
226373 | 0.88889 | The movie is well crafted , and well executed .
226378 | 0.33333 | The movie is without intent .
226379 | 0.18056 | The movie makes absolutely no sense .
226380 | 0.47222 | The movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as Jules Verne 's ' 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea ' and the George Pal version of H.G. Wells ' ` The Time Machine . '
226382 | 0.44444 | The movie occasionally threatens to become didactic , but it 's too grounded in the reality of its characters to go over the edge .
226383 | 0.30556 | The movie would seem less of a trifle if Ms. Sugarman followed through on her defiance of the saccharine .
226384 | 0.44444 | The name says it all .

226392 | 0.38889 | The only question ... is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering .
226394 | 0.125 | The only thing `` swept away '' is the one hour and thirty-three minutes spent watching this waste of time .
226396 | 0.041667 | The only thing to fear about `` Fear Dot Com '' is hitting your head on the theater seat in front of you when you doze off thirty minutes into the film .
226406 | 0.73611 | The otherwise good-naturedness of Mr. Deeds , with its embrace of sheer goofiness and cameos of less - than-likely New York celebrities ... certainly raises the film above anything Sandler 's been attached to before .
226408 | 0.80556 | The overall fabric is hypnotic , and Mr. Mattei fosters moments of spontaneous intimacy .
226409 | 0.27778 | The overall feel is not unlike watching a glorified episode of `` 7th Heaven . ''
226410 | 0.54167 | The path Ice Age follows most closely , though , is the one established by Warner Bros. giant Chuck Jones , who died a matter of weeks before the movie 's release .
226413 | 0.51389 | The performances are all solid ; it merely lacks originality to make it a great movie .
226414 | 0.11111 | The performances are so overstated , the effect comes off as self-parody .

226436 | 0.16667 | The premise itself is just SOOOOO tired .
226442 | 0.23611 | The premise of `` Abandon '' holds promise , ... but its delivery is a complete mess .
226443 | 0.22222 | The problem , it is with most of these things , is the script .
226444 | 0.44444 | The problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , Mr. Desplechin is content to state it .
226445 | 0.19444 | The problem is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage .
226447 | 0.23611 | The problem with `` XXX '' is that its own action is n't very effective .
226448 | 0.22222 | The problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one , there 's no saving the movie .
226449 | 0.36111 | The problem with movies about angels is they have a tendency to slip into hokum .
226451 | 0.26389 | The problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of Auschwitz II-Birkenau .
226452 | 0.29167 | The problem with this film is that it lacks focus .
226454 | 0.48611 | The problems of the people in Love in the Time of Money are hardly specific to their era .
