109783 | 0.22222 | The film can depress you about life itself .
109790 | 0.11111 | The film feels formulaic , its plot and pacing typical Hollywood war-movie stuff , while the performances elicit more of a sense of deja vu than awe .
109793 | 0.41667 | The film has a childlike quality about it .
109816 | 0.22222 | The film itself is about something very interesting and odd that would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative .
109821 | 0.41667 | The film makes strong arguments regarding the social status of America 's indigenous people , but really only exists to try to eke out an emotional tug of the heart , one which it fails to get .

109843 | 0.41667 | The film thrusts the inchoate but already eldritch Christian Right propaganda machine into national media circles .
109846 | 0.33333 | The film ultimately offers nothing more than people in an urban jungle needing other people to survive ...

109901 | 0.45833 | The inevitable double - and triple-crosses arise , but the only drama is in waiting to hear how John Malkovich 's reedy consigliere will pronounce his next line .
109904 | 0.22222 | The inherent limitations of using a video game as the source material movie are once again made all too clear in this schlocky horror\/action hybrid .
109910 | 0.48611 | The isolated moments of creative insanity finally are lost in the thin soup of canned humor .
109918 | 0.16667 | The jokes are flat , and the action looks fake .

109945 | 0.27778 | The main story ... is compelling enough , but it 's difficult to shrug off the annoyance of that chatty fish .
109948 | 0.34722 | The makers of Mothman Prophecies succeed in producing that most frightening of all movies -- a mediocre horror film too bad to be good and too good to be bad .
109951 | 0.47222 | The messy emotions raging throughout this three-hour effort are instantly recognizable , allowing the film to paradoxically feel familiar and foreign at the same time .
109954 | 0.125 | The misery of these people becomes just another voyeuristic spectacle , to be consumed and forgotten .
109978 | 0.18056 | The most offensive thing about the movie is that Hollywood expects people to pay to see it .
109981 | 0.31944 | The most opaque , self-indulgent and just plain goofy an excuse for a movie as you can imagine .
109986 | 0.34722 | The movie , like Bartleby , is something of a stiff -- an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes .
109987 | 0.47222 | The movie , while beautiful , feels labored , with a hint of the writing exercise about it .
109992 | 0.25 | The movie attempts to mine laughs from a genre -- the gangster\/crime comedy -- that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago , and its cutesy reliance on movie-specific cliches is n't exactly endearing .
109993 | 0.34722 | The movie is a mess from start to finish .
109994 | 0.27778 | The movie is as padded as Allen 's jelly belly .
110004 | 0.375 | The movie is loaded with good intentions , but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the Holocaust escape story , Minac drains his movie of all individuality .
110006 | 0.083333 | The movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it .
110008 | 0.23611 | The movie keeps coming back to the achingly unfunny Phonce and his several silly subplots .
110009 | 0.30556 | The movie starts with a legend and ends with a story that is so far-fetched it would be impossible to believe if it were n't true .
110011 | 0.29167 | The movie weighs no more than a glass of flat champagne .
110016 | 0.47222 | The movie worked for me right up to the final scene , and then it caved in .

110032 | 0.38889 | The new film of Anton Chekhov 's The Cherry Orchard puts the ` ick ' in ` classic . '
110042 | 0.083333 | The notion of deleting emotion from people , even in an advanced Prozac Nation , is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed Equilibrium becomes a concept doofus .
110045 | 0.38889 | The one not-so-small problem with Expecting is that the entire exercise has no real point .
110050 | 0.375 | The only surprise is that heavyweights Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis agreed to produce this ; I assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies ' underwear .
110053 | 0.30556 | The only thing I laughed at were the people who paid to see it .
110055 | 0.15278 | The only thing that distinguishes a Randall Wallace film from any other is the fact that there is nothing distinguishing in a Randall Wallace film .
110062 | 0.29167 | The overall vibe is druggy and self-indulgent , like a spring-break orgy for pretentious arts majors .
110065 | 0.25 | The package in which this fascinating -- and timely -- content comes wrapped is disappointingly generic .
110067 | 0.44444 | The party scenes deliver some tawdry kicks .
110080 | 0.41667 | The philosophical musings of the dialogue jar against the tawdry soap opera antics of the film 's action in a way that is surprisingly enjoyable .
110090 | 0.20833 | The plot grows thin soon , and you find yourself praying for a quick resolution .
110091 | 0.44444 | The plot plummets into a comedy graveyard before Janice comes racing to the rescue in the final reel .
110097 | 0.43056 | The problem is not that it 's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes .
110099 | 0.25 | The problem is that Van Wilder does little that is actually funny with the material .
110100 | 0.18056 | The problem is that it is one that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another .
110103 | 0.097222 | The problem with ANTWONE FISHER is that it has a screenplay written by Antwone Fisher based on the book by Antwone Fisher .
110117 | 0.26389 | The re - enactments , however fascinating they may be as history , are too crude to serve the work especially well .
110127 | 0.5 | The respective charms of Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant have worn threadbare .
110134 | 0.18056 | The result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today 's Hollywood .
110136 | 0.5 | The result might look like Vulgar .
110137 | 0.31944 | The results are far more alienating than involving .
110144 | 0.41667 | The script 's snazzy dialogue establishes a realistic atmosphere that involves us in the unfolding crisis , but the lazy plotting ensures that little of our emotional investment pays off .
110145 | 0.33333 | The script becomes lifeless and falls apart like a cheap lawn chair .
110148 | 0.26389 | The script covers huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that does n't offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people .
110149 | 0.125 | The script falls back on too many tried-and-true shenanigans that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy .
110152 | 0.375 | The sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give Blade fans another look at Wesley Snipes ' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once .
110155 | 0.34722 | The setting turns out to be more interesting than any of the character dramas , which never reach satisfying conclusions .
110164 | 0.33333 | The skirmishes for power waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense .
110172 | 0.31944 | The story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than I 'd care to count .
110175 | 0.47222 | The story is so light and sugary that were it a Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade balloon , extra heavy-duty ropes would be needed to keep it from floating away .
110180 | 0.47222 | The story is virtually impossible to follow here , but there 's a certain style and wit to the dialogue .
110186 | 0.13889 | The story suffers a severe case of oversimplification , superficiality and silliness .
110194 | 0.5 | The symbols float like butterflies and the spinning styx sting like bees .

110217 | 0.20833 | The trappings of I Spy are so familiar you might as well be watching a rerun .
110220 | 0.29167 | The trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness .
110243 | 0.43056 | The video work is so grainy and rough , so dependent on being ` naturalistic ' rather than carefully lit and set up , that it 's exhausting to watch .
110248 | 0.083333 | The waterlogged script plumbs uncharted depths of stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric sexual banter .
110251 | 0.27778 | The weird thing about The Santa Clause 2 , purportedly a children 's movie , is that there is nothing in it to engage children emotionally .
110253 | 0.45833 | The whole affair is as predictable as can be .

110278 | 0.22222 | There 's a great deal of corny dialogue and preposterous moments .
110286 | 0.41667 | There 's a lot of good material here , but there 's also a lot of redundancy and unsuccessful crudeness accompanying it .
110292 | 0.38889 | There 's a reason why halftime is only fifteen minutes long .
110299 | 0.29167 | There 's an excellent 90-minute film here ; unfortunately , it runs for 170 .
110300 | 0.33333 | There 's more repetition than creativity throughout the movie .
110311 | 0.43056 | There 's no getting around the fact that this is Revenge Of The Nerds Revisited -- again .
110312 | 0.33333 | There 's no good answer to that one .
110313 | 0.34722 | There 's no point in extracting the bare bones of Byatt 's plot for purposes of bland Hollywood romance .
110318 | 0.33333 | There 's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of Joan 's prefeminist plight , so we 're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity .

110325 | 0.20833 | There 's nothing remotely topical or sexy here .
110326 | 0.11111 | There 's nothing to gain from watching They .
110336 | 0.22222 | There 's something unintentionally comic in the film 's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties .
110337 | 0.27778 | There 's the plot , and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream .
110344 | 0.29167 | There are few things more frustrating to a film buff than seeing an otherwise good movie marred beyond redemption by a disastrous ending .
110356 | 0.33333 | There are some fairly unsettling scenes , but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer .

146506 | 0.26389 | It 's hard to tell with all the crashing and banging where the salesmanship ends and the movie begins .
146517 | 0.23611 | It 's inoffensive , cheerful , built to inspire the young people , set to an unending soundtrack of beach party pop numbers and aside from its remarkable camerawork and awesome scenery , it 's about as exciting as a sunburn .
146518 | 0.30556 | It 's just a silly black genre spoof .
146522 | 0.33333 | It 's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface .
146525 | 0.23611 | It 's just hard to believe that a life like this can sound so dull .
146526 | 0.097222 | It 's just incredibly dull .
146527 | 0.23611 | It 's just plain lurid when it is n't downright silly .
146533 | 0.31944 | It 's leaden and predictable , and laughs are lacking .

146539 | 0.40278 | It 's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes .
146544 | 0.23611 | It 's mildly amusing , but I certainly ca n't recommend it .
146545 | 0.18056 | It 's never a good sign when a film 's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma .
146551 | 0.375 | It 's not as awful as some of the recent Hollywood trip tripe ... but it 's far from a groundbreaking endeavor .
146553 | 0.18056 | It 's not horrible , just horribly mediocre .

146567 | 0.31944 | It 's not that Kung Pow is n't funny some of the time -- it just is n't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all Oedekerk 's impish augmentation .
146570 | 0.36111 | It 's not the ultimate Depression-era gangster movie .
146582 | 0.30556 | It 's of the quality of a lesser Harrison Ford movie - Six Days , Seven Nights , maybe , or that dreadful Sabrina remake .
146587 | 0.375 | It 's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold .
146589 | 0.20833 | It 's one long bore .
146598 | 0.15278 | It 's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions .
146599 | 0.097222 | It 's painful .
146601 | 0.31944 | It 's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up .
146607 | 0.29167 | It 's push-the-limits teen comedy , the type written by people who ca n't come up with legitimate funny , and it 's used so extensively that good bits are hopelessly overshadowed .
146608 | 0.29167 | It 's really yet another anemic and formulaic Lethal Weapon-derived buddy-cop movie , trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness .
146615 | 0.13889 | It 's so badly made on every level that I 'm actually having a hard time believing people were paid to make it .
146616 | 0.20833 | It 's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it 's left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence .
146617 | 0.16667 | It 's so full of wrong choices that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief -- and worry about what classic Oliver Parker intends to mangle next time .
146618 | 0.34722 | It 's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just ca n't get no satisfaction .
146619 | 0.26389 | It 's so underwritten that you ca n't figure out just where the other characters , including Ana 's father and grandfather , come down on the issue of Ana 's future .
146621 | 0.43056 | It 's sweet , harmless , dumb , occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show .
146627 | 0.29167 | It 's the kind of movie you ca n't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you ca n't bring yourself to dislike it .
146629 | 0.18056 | It 's too interested in jerking off in all its Byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience .
146630 | 0.43056 | It 's too long , too repetitive , and takes way too many years to resolve to be a total winner .
146631 | 0.36111 | It 's too self-important and plodding to be funny , and too clipped and abbreviated to be an epic .
146637 | 0.13889 | It all drags on so interminably it 's like watching a miserable relationship unfold in real time .
146638 | 0.19444 | It all feels like a Monty Python sketch gone horribly wrong .
146640 | 0.30556 | It appears that something has been lost in the translation to the screen .
146643 | 0.29167 | It becomes gimmicky instead of compelling .
146647 | 0.41667 | It believes it 's revealing some great human truths , when , in reality , it 's churning ground that has long passed the point of being fertile .
146648 | 0.33333 | It ca n't decide if it wants to be a mystery\/thriller , a romance or a comedy .
146650 | 0.25 | It concentrates far too much on the awkward interplay and utter lack of chemistry between Chan and Hewitt .
146652 | 0.33333 | It delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for Deeper Meaning .
146659 | 0.27778 | It does n't do the original any particular dishonor , but neither does it exude any charm or personality .
146660 | 0.13889 | It does n't help that the director and cinematographer Stephen Kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel .
146671 | 0.45833 | It does n't quite work , but there 's enough here to make us look forward to the Russos ' next offering .
146672 | 0.23611 | It does nothing new with the old story , except to show fisticuffs in this sort of stop-go slow motion that makes the gang rumbles look like they 're being streamed over a 28K modem .
146676 | 0.125 | It feels like a community theater production of a great Broadway play : Even at its best , it will never hold a candle to the original .
146681 | 0.13889 | It feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes .
146693 | 0.33333 | It gets the details of its time frame right but it completely misses its emotions .
146696 | 0.38889 | It has all the excitement of eating oatmeal .
146697 | 0.30556 | It has its moments of swaggering camaraderie , but more often just feels generic , derivative and done to death .
146698 | 0.44444 | It is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie ... but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made Eurotrash cult object .
146702 | 0.29167 | It is just too bad the film 's story does not live up to its style .
146706 | 0.33333 | It is most of the things Costner movies are known for ; it 's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it .
146712 | 0.47222 | It kinda works and qualifies as cool at times , but is just too lame to work or be cool at others .
146718 | 0.38889 | It made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen .
146719 | 0.43056 | It makes sense that he went back to school to check out the girls -- his film is a frat boy 's idea of a good time .
146729 | 0.33333 | It may be an easy swipe to take , but this Barbershop just does n't make the cut .
146731 | 0.43056 | It might be the first sci-fi comedy that could benefit from a Three 's Company-style laugh track .
146732 | 0.31944 | It offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment .
146735 | 0.47222 | It seems just a long , convoluted ploy to get men into drag -- period drag , no less .
146736 | 0.27778 | It settles for being merely grim .
146741 | 0.22222 | It showcases Carvey 's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one 's patience to get to the good stuff .
146742 | 0.25 | It smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original .
146743 | 0.22222 | It sticks rigidly to the paradigm , rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived , well-worn situations .
146749 | 0.11111 | It takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as ` worse than expected , ' but Ghost Ship somehow manages to do exactly that .
146750 | 0.11111 | It takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of Robert Forster , Anne Meara , Eugene Levy , and Reginald VelJohnson all in the same movie .
146751 | 0.29167 | It takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived .
146752 | 0.5 | It tells more than it shows .
146753 | 0.19444 | It treats women like idiots .
146754 | 0.31944 | It tries too hard , and overreaches the logic of its own world .
146755 | 0.45833 | It uses the pain and violence of war as background material for color .
146756 | 0.30556 | It virtually defines a comedy that 's strongly mediocre , with funny bits surfacing every once in a while .
146761 | 0.5 | It wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy .
146762 | 0.29167 | It will come as no surprise that the movie is n't scary .
146772 | 0.43056 | It will probably prove interesting to Ram Dass fans , but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow , peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture .
146773 | 0.38889 | It wo n't be long before you 'll spy I Spy at a video store near you .
146774 | 0.041667 | It would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi .
146775 | 0.16667 | It would be hard to think of a recent movie that has worked this hard to achieve this little fun .
146776 | 0.45833 | It would have benefitted the dialogue .
146778 | 0.40278 | It would work much better as a one-hour TV documentary .
146780 | 0.25 | Its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper .
146788 | 0.20833 | Its lack of quality earns it a place alongside those other two recent Dumas botch-jobs , The Man in the Iron Mask and The Musketeer .
146791 | 0.20833 | Its over-reliance on genre conventions , character types and formulaic conflict resolutions crushes all the goodwill it otherwise develops .
146793 | 0.33333 | Its salient points are simultaneously buried , drowned and smothered in the excesses of writer-director Roger Avary .
146796 | 0.29167 | Its save-the-planet message clashes with its crass marketing .
146797 | 0.29167 | Its story may be a thousand years old , but why did it have to seem like it took another thousand to tell it to us ?
146806 | 0.44444 | Ja Rule and Kurupt should have gotten to rap .
146812 | 0.36111 | Jackson shamefully strolls through this mess with a smug grin , inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder .
146816 | 0.47222 | Jacquot 's rendering of Puccini 's tale of devotion and double-cross is more than just a filmed opera .
146820 | 0.26389 | Jaglom offers the none-too-original premise that everyone involved with moviemaking is a con artist and a liar .
146850 | 0.30556 | Jason X is positively anti-Darwinian : nine sequels and 400 years later , the teens are none the wiser and Jason still kills on auto-pilot .
146902 | 0.18056 | John Leguizamo may be a dramatic actor -- just not in this movie .
146917 | 0.5 | Johnson has , in his first film , set himself a task he is not nearly up to .
146920 | 0.34722 | Jolie 's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips .
146925 | 0.5 | Jones helps breathe some life into the insubstantial plot , but even he is overwhelmed by predictability .
146931 | 0.38889 | Judd 's characters ought to pick up the durable best seller Smart Women , Foolish Choices for advice .
146934 | 0.15278 | Julia is played with exasperating blandness by Laura Regan .
146939 | 0.22222 | Just a bloody mess .
146944 | 0.22222 | Just a string of stale gags , with no good inside dope , and no particular bite .
146950 | 0.15278 | Just another disjointed , fairly predictable psychological thriller .
146952 | 0.23611 | Just because it really happened to you , honey , does n't mean that it 's interesting to anyone else .
146957 | 0.5 | Just how extreme are these ops ?
146960 | 0.16667 | Just like Hearst 's enormous yacht , it 's slow and unwieldy and takes a long time to reach its destination .
146962 | 0.44444 | Just like every other Seagal movie , only louder and without that silly ponytail .
146968 | 0.375 | Just one bad idea after another .
146972 | 0.44444 | Just one problem : Fish out of water usually die .
146974 | 0.29167 | Just when the movie seems confident enough to handle subtlety , it dives into soapy bathos .
146976 | 0.19444 | K-19 exploits our substantial collective fear of nuclear holocaust to generate cheap Hollywood tension .
146981 | 0.22222 | K-19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic , but it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy Saving Private Ryanovich .
147007 | 0.41667 | Kenneth Branagh 's energetic sweet-and-sour performance as a curmudgeonly British playwright grounds this overstuffed , erratic dramedy in which he and his improbably forbearing wife contend with craziness and child-rearing in Los Angeles .
147042 | 0.20833 | Kung Pow is Oedekerk 's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that .
147045 | 0.36111 | Kwan makes the mix-and - match metaphors intriguing , while lulling us into torpor with his cultivated allergy to action .
147057 | 0.25 | Lacking substance and soul , Crossroads comes up shorter than Britney 's cutoffs .
147059 | 0.19444 | Lacks heart , depth and , most of all , purpose .
147063 | 0.26389 | Laconic and very stilted in its dialogue , this indie flick never found its audience , probably because it 's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters .
147074 | 0.19444 | Lame , haphazard teen comedy .
147076 | 0.33333 | Lame Sweet Home leaves no Southern stereotype unturned .
147083 | 0.34722 | Lanie 's professional success means she must be a failure at life , because she 's driven by ambition and Does n't Know How to Have Fun .
147088 | 0.44444 | Largely , this is a movie that also does it by the numbers .
147089 | 0.47222 | Largely a for-fans artifact .
147102 | 0.45833 | Lawrence preaches strictly to the converted .
147108 | 0.22222 | Leaves you with a knot in your stomach , its power is undercut by its own head-banging obviousness .
147125 | 0.33333 | Less a study in madness or love than a study in schoolgirl obsession .
147127 | 0.25 | Less dizzying than just dizzy , the jaunt is practically over before it begins .
147132 | 0.44444 | Less worrying about covering all the drama in Frida 's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie .
147137 | 0.19444 | Let 's cut to the consumer-advice bottom line : Stay home .
147144 | 0.38889 | Let your silly childhood nostalgia slumber unmolested .
147149 | 0.38889 | Life is a crock -- or something like it .
147161 | 0.125 | Like a can of 2-day old Coke .
147168 | 0.5 | Like a documentary version of Fight Club , shorn of social insight , intellectual pretension and cinematic interest .
147172 | 0.16667 | Like being trapped at a perpetual frat party ... How can something so gross be so boring ?
147174 | 0.22222 | Like coming into a long-running , well-written television series where you 've missed the first half-dozen episodes and probably wo n't see the next six .
147176 | 0.27778 | Like most sequels , it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness .
147178 | 0.16667 | Like so many other allegedly scary movies , it gets so tangled up in The Twist that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten .
147180 | 0.40278 | Like the Chelsea 's denizens ... Burdette 's collage-form scenario tends to over-romanticize the spiritual desolation of the struggling artiste .
147182 | 0.375 | Like those to Rome , all roads in The Banger Sisters inevitably lead to a joke about Hawn 's breasts , which constantly threaten to upstage the woman sporting them .
147184 | 0.27778 | Like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up : everything 's in place but something 's just a little off-kilter .
147191 | 0.29167 | Liman , of Swingers and Go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase .
147216 | 0.23611 | Little more than a frothy vanity project .
147224 | 0.5 | Long Time Dead ?
147232 | 0.20833 | Looks and feels like a low-budget hybrid of Scarface or Carlito 's Way .
147234 | 0.31944 | Looks and feels like a project better suited for the small screen .
147235 | 0.38889 | Looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a Mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter 's imagination .
147237 | 0.055556 | Looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due .
147256 | 0.31944 | Louiso lets the movie dawdle in classic disaffected-indie-film mode , and brother Hoffman 's script stumbles over a late-inning twist that just does n't make sense .
147262 | 0.26389 | Love may have been in the air onscreen , but I certainly was n't feeling any of it .
147295 | 0.19444 | Made by jackasses for jackasses .

147328 | 0.5 | Malone does have a gift for generating nightmarish images that will be hard to burn out of your brain .
147332 | 0.13889 | Manages to be both repulsively sadistic and mundane .
147333 | 0.43056 | Manages to be somewhat well-acted , not badly art-directed and utterly unengaging no matter how hard it tries to be thrilling , touching or , yikes , uproarious .
147334 | 0.22222 | Manages to show life in all of its banality when the intention is quite the opposite .
147346 | 0.31944 | Mark me down as a non-believer in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor .
147353 | 0.22222 | Marries the amateurishness of The Blair Witch Project with the illogic of Series 7 : The Contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie .
147368 | 0.16667 | Mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity .
147372 | 0.11111 | Matthew McConaughey tries , and fails , to control the screen with swaggering machismo and over-the-top lunacy .
147377 | 0.33333 | Maudlin and melodramatic we expected .
147382 | 0.125 | May cause you to bite your tongue to keep from laughing at the ridiculous dialog or the oh-so convenient plot twists .
147385 | 0.27778 | May reawaken discussion of the Kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen .

147491 | 0.22222 | More whiny downer than corruscating commentary .

147638 | 0.18056 | Nelson 's brutally unsentimental approach ... sucks the humanity from the film , leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle .
147643 | 0.23611 | Nervous breakdowns are not entertaining .
147647 | 0.22222 | Never Again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and , along the way , expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds .

147654 | 0.30556 | Never engaging , utterly predictable and completely void of anything remotely interesting or suspenseful .

147705 | 0.30556 | No , it 's not nearly as good as any of its influences .

147733 | 0.16667 | No way I can believe this load of junk .
147739 | 0.48611 | No worse than a lot of the crap we 've been offered this summer , and slightly better than Men in Black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go .
147742 | 0.23611 | None of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest .
147744 | 0.25 | None of these characters resembles anyone you 've ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter .
147746 | 0.22222 | None of this violates the letter of Behan 's book , but missing is its spirit , its ribald , full-throated humor .
147756 | 0.31944 | Normally , Rohmer 's talky films fascinate me , but when he moves his setting to the past , and relies on a historical text , he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable .
147764 | 0.44444 | Not a cheap slasher flick , as the subject matter would suggest , but is a little like a nature film , showing a patient predator and his foolish prey .

147794 | 0.23611 | Not only is it hokey , manipulative and as bland as Wonder Bread dipped in milk , but it also does the absolute last thing we need Hollywood doing to us : It preaches .
147796 | 0.11111 | Not only unfunny , but downright repellent .
147798 | 0.375 | Not really bad so much as distasteful : We need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers .

149246 | 0.26389 | The bottom line , at least in my opinion , is Imposter makes a better short story than it does a film .

149280 | 0.19444 | The cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama .

149402 | 0.23611 | The film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle .
149403 | 0.40278 | The film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending .
149412 | 0.11111 | The film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously .
149416 | 0.27778 | The film is based on truth and yet there is something about it that feels incomplete , as if the real story starts just around the corner .

149422 | 0.25 | The film is really closer to porn than a serious critique of what 's wrong with this increasingly pervasive aspect of gay culture .
149423 | 0.26389 | The film is really not so much bad as bland .
149426 | 0.25 | The film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises .
149430 | 0.23611 | The film makes a fatal mistake : It asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life .
149432 | 0.23611 | The film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but was n't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing .
149433 | 0.33333 | The film might have been more satisfying if it had , in fact , been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles .

149499 | 0.375 | The kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion .
149501 | 0.5 | The kind of spectacularly misconceived enterprise that only a sophisticated cinephile could have perpetrated .

149508 | 0.31944 | The lack of pace kills it , although , in a movie about cancer , this might be apt .
149515 | 0.27778 | The last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming , but most of the movie is the same teenage American road-trip drek we 've seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokes

149529 | 0.23611 | The longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it 's actually pretty good in the first few minutes .
149535 | 0.33333 | The low-budget Full Frontal was one of the year 's murkiest , intentionally obscure and self-indulgent pictures , and Solaris is its big-budget brother .

149556 | 0.25 | The more Kevin Costner rests on his pretty-boy laurels , the public is , regrettably , going to have tepid films like Dragonfly tossed at them .
149559 | 0.18056 | The most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take .
149561 | 0.36111 | The movie 's accumulated force still feels like an ugly knot tightening in your stomach .
149564 | 0.27778 | The movie 's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension .
149568 | 0.34722 | The movie , directed by Mick Jackson , leaves no cliche unturned , from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting .
149569 | 0.34722 | The movie bounces all over the map .
149570 | 0.25 | The movie does n't add anything fresh to the myth .
149571 | 0.29167 | The movie does n't think much of its characters , its protagonist , or of us .
149572 | 0.27778 | The movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter ` uhhh , ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie .
149573 | 0.22222 | The movie eventually snaps under the strain of its plot contrivances and its need to reassure .
149574 | 0.26389 | The movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts .

149584 | 0.25 | The movie gets muted and routine .
149590 | 0.30556 | The movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs .
149591 | 0.33333 | The movie is Dawn of the Dead crossed with John Carpenter 's Ghosts of Mars , with zombies not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second .
149592 | 0.16667 | The movie is a desperate miscalculation .
149600 | 0.38889 | The movie is a lumbering load of hokum but ... it 's at least watchable .
149604 | 0.15278 | The movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel .
149609 | 0.44444 | The movie is too cute to take itself too seriously , but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students .
149610 | 0.22222 | The movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that 's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads .
149615 | 0.45833 | The movie just has too much on its plate to really stay afloat for its just under ninety minute running time .
149617 | 0.23611 | The movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable .
149619 | 0.125 | The movie slides downhill as soon as macho action conventions assert themselves .
149624 | 0.20833 | The movie straddles the fence between escapism and social commentary , and on both sides it falls short .
149625 | 0.26389 | The movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark .
149630 | 0.27778 | The movie takes itself too seriously and , as a result , it makes for only intermittent fun .
149633 | 0.097222 | The moviegoing equivalent of going to a dinner party and being forced to watch the host and hostess 's home video of their baby 's birth .
149635 | 0.41667 | The narrative is so consistently unimaginative that probably the only way to have saved the film is with the aid of those wisecracking Mystery Science Theater 3000 guys .
149641 | 0.48611 | The new faces are interesting , but the old story is n't , especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted .
149648 | 0.20833 | The noble tradition of men in drag hits an all-time low in Sorority Boys , whose makers apparently believe that women 's clothing can cover up any deficiency in acting , writing or direction .
149650 | 0.11111 | The notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy .
149653 | 0.13889 | The only camouflage Carvey should now be considering is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public , to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers .
149656 | 0.18056 | The only element of suspense is whether the movie will change titles or distributors again before the closing credits roll .

149666 | 0.375 | The only thing in Pauline and Paulette that you have n't seen before is a scene featuring a football field-sized Oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers .

149674 | 0.083333 | The only thing worse than your substandard , run-of-the-mill Hollywood picture is an angst-ridden attempt to be profound .
149677 | 0.055556 | The only way this supernatural snore-fest could give anyone a case of the frights is if they were put to sleep by the movie and had a nightmare .
149679 | 0.027778 | The only way to tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers .
149684 | 0.18056 | The original was n't a good movie but this remake makes it look like a masterpiece !
149685 | 0.29167 | The overall effect is less like a children 's movie than a recruitment film for future Hollywood sellouts .
149686 | 0.16667 | The overall effect is so completely inane that one would have to be mighty bored to even think of staying with this for more than , say , ten ... make that three minutes .
149694 | 0.25 | The overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there 's still a real sense that the Star Trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction .
149704 | 0.41667 | The pacing is glacial , the screenplay is stiff as a board , and things heat up only in the movie 's final scenes .
149717 | 0.25 | The performances are so leaden , Michael Rymer 's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud .
149724 | 0.25 | The picture , scored by a perversely cheerful Marcus Miller accordion\/harmonica\/banjo abomination , is a monument to bad in all its florid variety .
149725 | 0.31944 | The picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know-how mixes with lack of give-a-damn .
149727 | 0.31944 | The piquant story needs more dramatic meat on its bones .
149729 | 0.26389 | The pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film ca n't help but go soft and stinky .
149732 | 0.16667 | The plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience 's chain .
149733 | 0.19444 | The plot grinds on with yawn-provoking dullness .
149738 | 0.30556 | The plot has a number of holes , and at times it 's simply baffling .
149739 | 0.22222 | The plot is plastered with one Hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults .
149743 | 0.29167 | The plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before Sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset .
149745 | 0.20833 | The plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television - caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy .
149750 | 0.375 | The plot is very clever , but Boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of .
149752 | 0.15278 | The predominantly amateur cast is painful to watch , so stilted and unconvincing are the performances .
149758 | 0.29167 | The premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written ... in the thrall of a vicious hangover .
149763 | 0.18056 | The premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film 's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them .
149764 | 0.31944 | The premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the Clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences .
149765 | 0.26389 | The problem is n't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of Schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball .
149767 | 0.29167 | The problem is that the movie has no idea of it is serious or not .
149771 | 0.23611 | The problem with this film is that it 's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot .
149790 | 0.5 | The reason I found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory .
149792 | 0.26389 | The reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone .
149795 | 0.31944 | The result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a Halloween that died .
149796 | 0.33333 | The result is solemn and horrifying , yet strangely detached .
149799 | 0.38889 | The sad thing about Knockaround Guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film is n't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is .
149801 | 0.25 | The screenplay by James Eric , James Horton and director Peter O'Fallon ... is so pat it makes your teeth hurt .
149804 | 0.22222 | The screenplay sabotages the movie 's strengths at almost every juncture .
149814 | 0.36111 | The script boasts some tart TV-insider humor , but the film has not a trace of humanity or empathy .
149818 | 0.34722 | The script has less spice than a rat burger and The Rock 's fighting skills are more in line with Steven Seagal .
149819 | 0.20833 | The script is a tired one , with few moments of joy rising above the stale material .
149829 | 0.16667 | The sequel has turned completely and irrevocably bizarre to the point of utter nonsense .
149832 | 0.19444 | The sinister inspiration that fuelled DeVito 's early work is confused in Death to Smoochy into something both ugly and mindless .
149834 | 0.23611 | The situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels .
149837 | 0.16667 | The smug , oily demeanor that Donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named Pipe Dream is just repulsive .
149841 | 0.083333 | The sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap .
149847 | 0.27778 | The soul-searching deliberateness of the film , although leavened nicely with dry absurdist wit , eventually becomes too heavy for the plot .
149849 | 0.34722 | The stories here suffer from the chosen format .
149850 | 0.16667 | The story 's so preposterous that I did n't believe it for a second , despite the best efforts of everyone involved .
149851 | 0.125 | The story ... is moldy and obvious .
149854 | 0.34722 | The story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough .
149856 | 0.27778 | The story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you 're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships .
149857 | 0.23611 | The story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence .
149863 | 0.36111 | The story has its redundancies , and the young actors , not very experienced , are sometimes inexpressive .
149868 | 0.33333 | The story is -- forgive me -- a little thin , and the filmmaking clumsy and rushed .
149872 | 0.38889 | The story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly - stunning insight that crime does n't pay .
149878 | 0.38889 | The story is naturally poignant , but first-time screenwriter Paul Pender overloads it with sugary bits of business .
149880 | 0.20833 | The story the movie tells is of Brian De Palma 's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career .
149889 | 0.26389 | The streets , shot by cinematographer Michael Ballhaus , may be as authentic as they are mean , but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them .
149895 | 0.48611 | The stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious .
149900 | 0 | The stupidest , most insulting movie of 2002 's first quarter .
149903 | 0.33333 | The subject of swinging still seems ripe for a documentary -- just not this one .
149913 | 0.29167 | The talented and clever Robert Rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film and did n't reserve enough for his second .
149919 | 0.41667 | The techno tux is good for a few laughs , as are Chan and Hewitt , but when such a good design turns out to be a cheap knockoff , we ca n't recommend anything but a rental for The Tuxedo .
149928 | 0.20833 | The thriller side of this movie is falling flat , as the stalker does n't do much stalking , and no cop or lawyer grasps the concept of actually investigating the case .
149931 | 0.38889 | The timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off .
149935 | 0.16667 | The title 's lameness should clue you in on how bad the movie is .
149937 | 0.375 | The title Trapped turns out to be a pretty fair description of how you feel while you 're watching this ultra-manipulative thriller .
149944 | 0.23611 | The title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well .
149945 | 0.26389 | The tone shifts abruptly from tense to celebratory to soppy .
149947 | 0.27778 | The truth is that The Truth About Charlie gets increasingly tiresome .
149950 | 0.25 | The tug-of-war at the core of Beijing Bicycle becomes weighed down with agonizing contrivances , overheated pathos and long , wistful gazes .
149957 | 0.43056 | The twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows .
149962 | 0.33333 | The two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect .
149965 | 0.083333 | The unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive , the director just ends up exposing his own obsession .
149971 | 0.30556 | The verdict : Two bodies and hardly a laugh between them .
149985 | 0.27778 | The whole damn thing is ripe for the Jerry Springer crowd .

150049 | 0.36111 | There 's no denying the elaborateness of the artist 's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity .

150062 | 0.26389 | There 's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought .
150063 | 0.34722 | There 's plenty of style in Guillermo Del Toro 's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply ca n't sustain more than 90 minutes .

150066 | 0.5 | There 's something not entirely convincing about The Quiet American .
150074 | 0.45833 | There 's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like Lavinia , to go the conservative route .
150080 | 0.23611 | There 's suspension of disbelief and then there 's bad screenwriting ... this film packs a wallop of the latter .
150085 | 0.20833 | There 's too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging .

150104 | 0.27778 | There are weird resonances between actor and role here , and they 're not exactly flattering .
150106 | 0.45833 | There is an almost poignant dimension to the way that every major stunt Seagal 's character ... performs is shot from behind , as if it could fool us into thinking that we 're not watching a double .
150107 | 0.30556 | There is n't nearly enough fun here , despite the presence of some appealing ingredients .
150112 | 0.20833 | There is no entry portal in The Rules of Attraction , and I spent most of the movie feeling depressed by the shallow , selfish , greedy characters .

150116 | 0.16667 | There is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production .
150121 | 0.36111 | There is something in Full Frontal , I guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see .
150126 | 0.30556 | There is very little dread or apprehension , and though I like the creepy ideas , they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill .
150127 | 0.16667 | There ought to be a directing license , so that Ed Burns can have his revoked .

150198 | 0.25 | This goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring
150204 | 0.16667 | This idea has lost its originality ... and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture .

150348 | 0.26389 | Though Moonlight Mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that 's potentially moving , the movie is too predictable and too self-conscious to reach a level of high drama .
150350 | 0.375 | Though Perry and Hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by Jay Scherick and David Ronn , neither the actors nor director Reginald Hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining .
150354 | 0.43056 | Though certainly original in form , Altar Boys requires a taste for Swamp Thing-type animation , doubled with a deafening score .
150356 | 0.34722 | Though clearly well-intentioned , this cross-cultural soap opera is painfully formulaic and stilted .

184891 | 0.40278 | In his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , Silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls .
184893 | 0.29167 | In his role of observer of the scene , Lawrence sounds whiny and defensive , as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature .
184895 | 0.041667 | In my own very humble opinion , In Praise of Love lacks even the most fragmented charms I have found in almost all of his previous works .
184904 | 0.22222 | In spite of featuring a script credited to no fewer than five writers , apparently nobody here bothered to check it twice .
184906 | 0.19444 | In terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused .

184949 | 0.16667 | Instead of letting the laughs come as they may , Lawrence unleashes his trademark misogyny -- er , comedy -- like a human volcano or an overflowing septic tank , take your pick .
184953 | 0.27778 | Instead of using George and Lucy 's most obvious differences to ignite sparks , Lawrence desperately looks elsewhere , seizing on George 's haplessness and Lucy 's personality tics .
184962 | 0.19444 | Interminably bleak , to say nothing of boring .
184968 | 0.38889 | Interview With the Assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its Blair Witch Project real-time roots .

184996 | 0.22222 | It 's a Frankenstein-monster of a film that does n't know what it wants to be .
185000 | 0.13889 | It 's a bad action movie because there 's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring .
185001 | 0.083333 | It 's a barely tolerable slog over well-trod ground .
185006 | 0.22222 | It 's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled .
185013 | 0.5 | It 's a documentary that says that the alternate sexuality meant to set you free may require so much relationship maintenance that celibacy can start looking good .
185015 | 0.055556 | It 's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer 's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary .
185016 | 0.11111 | It 's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt Miramax felt they owed to Benigni .
185017 | 0.5 | It 's a gag that 's worn a bit thin over the years , though Do n't Ask still finds a few chuckles .
185022 | 0.25 | It 's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it does n't offer any insights that have n't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the Dahmer heyday of the mid - '90s .
185028 | 0.22222 | It 's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as Phoenix 's .
185030 | 0.27778 | It 's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex .
185032 | 0.33333 | It 's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition .
185033 | 0.125 | It 's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns .
185034 | 0.19444 | It 's a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes ... finally seem so impersonal or even shallow .
185036 | 0.125 | It 's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch .
185038 | 0.30556 | It 's a thin notion , repetitively stretched out to feature length , awash in self-consciously flashy camera effects , droning house music and flat , flat dialogue .
185042 | 0.40278 | It 's actually pretty funny , but in all the wrong places .
185046 | 0.40278 | It 's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick .
185050 | 0.36111 | It 's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it 's all about the silences and if you 're into that , have at it .
185051 | 0.5 | It 's all gratuitous before long , as if Schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story .
185052 | 0.125 | It 's all surface psychodramatics .
185053 | 0.41667 | It 's almost as if it 's an elaborate dare more than a full-blooded film .
185054 | 0.27778 | It 's also built on a faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness .
185058 | 0.36111 | It 's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise .
185059 | 0.38889 | It 's as if Allen , at 66 , has stopped challenging himself .
185071 | 0.18056 | It 's as sorry a mess as its director 's diabolical debut , Mad Cows .
185073 | 0.25 | It 's bedeviled by labored writing and slack direction .
185085 | 0.20833 | It 's better suited for the history or biography channel , but there 's no arguing the tone of the movie - it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and questions on your mind .
185086 | 0.25 | It 's clear why Deuces Wild , which was shot two years ago , has been gathering dust on MGM 's shelf .
185091 | 0.36111 | It 's coherent , well shot , and tartly acted , but it wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate .
185092 | 0.041667 | It 's crap on a leash -- far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of Joe Dante 's similarly styled Gremlins .
185094 | 0.40278 | It 's deep-sixed by a compulsion to catalog every bodily fluids gag in There 's Something About Mary and devise a parallel clone-gag .
185099 | 0.375 | It 's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and I think even fans of Sandler 's comic taste may find it uninteresting .
185100 | 0.25 | It 's depressing to see how far Herzog has fallen .
185101 | 0.5 | It 's difficult for a longtime admirer of his work to not be swept up in Invincible and overlook its drawbacks .

185103 | 0.40278 | It 's difficult to discern if this is a crazy work of disturbed genius or merely 90 minutes of post-adolescent Electra rebellion .
185104 | 0.22222 | It 's difficult to feel anything much while watching this movie , beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting .
185105 | 0.083333 | It 's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 .
185106 | 0.083333 | It 's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast .
185108 | 0.36111 | It 's exactly the kind of movie Toback 's detractors always accuse him of making .
185110 | 0.45833 | It 's fitfully funny but never really takes off .
185116 | 0.43056 | It 's hard to believe that a relationship like Holly and Marina 's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive .
185117 | 0.22222 | It 's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby .
185118 | 0.20833 | It 's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress .

185132 | 0.19444 | It 's horribly depressing and not very well done .
185133 | 0.27778 | It 's in the action scenes that things fall apart .
185136 | 0.45833 | It 's just plain boring .
185137 | 0.13889 | It 's just rather leaden and dull .
185142 | 0.23611 | It 's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness , and where Human Nature should be ingratiating , it 's just grating .
185143 | 0.20833 | It 's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey .
185144 | 0.5 | It 's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another .
185145 | 0.26389 | It 's like a drive-by .
185147 | 0.22222 | It 's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay .
185148 | 0.22222 | It 's makes a better travelogue than movie .
185149 | 0.25 | It 's mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist ... studiously inoffensive and completely disposable .
185150 | 0.48611 | It 's mindless junk like this that makes you appreciate original romantic comedies like Punch-Drunk Love .
185161 | 0.5 | It 's not a bad plot ; but , unfortunately , the movie is nowhere near as refined as all the classic dramas it borrows from .
185166 | 0.45833 | It 's not a particularly good film , but neither is it a monsterous one .
185168 | 0.20833 | It 's not helpful to listen to extremist name-calling , regardless of whether you think Kissinger was a calculating fiend or just a slippery self-promoter .
185169 | 0.20833 | It 's not original enough .
185176 | 0.40278 | It 's not the worst comedy of the year , but it certainly wo n't win any honors .
185181 | 0.22222 | It 's not too much of anything .
185191 | 0.16667 | It 's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling .
185196 | 0.31944 | It 's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by Taylor 's cartoonish performance and the film 's ill-considered notion that Hitler 's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances .
185197 | 0.19444 | It 's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the Cannes Film Festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere .
185201 | 0.34722 | It 's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline ; everything that 's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that 's just too boring and obvious .
185208 | 0.15278 | It 's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even Jason X ... look positively Shakesperean by comparison .
185209 | 0.33333 | It 's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead .
185210 | 0.26389 | It 's so tedious that it makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in Bridget Jones 's Diary .
185214 | 0.45833 | It 's supposed to be a humorous , all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up .
185218 | 0.23611 | It 's supposed to be a romantic comedy - it suffers from too much Norma Rae and not enough Pretty Woman .
185219 | 0.097222 | It 's supposed to be post-feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on Oprah .
185220 | 0.29167 | It 's surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction .
185225 | 0.45833 | It 's sweet ... but just a little bit too precious at the start and a little too familiar at the end .
185228 | 0.25 | It 's the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who does n't think about percentages all day long .
185230 | 0.083333 | It 's the kind of under-inspired , overblown enterprise that gives Hollywood sequels a bad name .
185231 | 0.41667 | It 's the movie equivalent of a sweaty old guy in a rain coat shopping for cheap porn .
185232 | 0.40278 | It 's too bad nothing else is .
185233 | 0.44444 | It 's tough being a black man in America , especially when the Man has taken away your car , your work-hours and denied you health insurance .
185234 | 0.11111 | It 's tough to be startled when you 're almost dozing .
185235 | 0.29167 | It 's tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie , directed by Scott Kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 Brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo .
185236 | 0.30556 | It 's unfortunate that Wallace , who wrote Gibson 's Braveheart as well as the recent Pearl Harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue .
185238 | 0.16667 | It aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one .
185240 | 0.20833 | It all seemed wasted like DeNiro 's once promising career and the once grand Long Beach boardwalk .
185241 | 0.27778 | It all starts to smack of a Hallmark Hall of Fame , with a few four letter words thrown in that are generally not heard on television .
185246 | 0.19444 | It all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense .
185247 | 0.26389 | It almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us .
185248 | 0.041667 | It appears as if even the filmmakers did n't know what kind of movie they were making .
185249 | 0.13889 | It appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept .
185255 | 0.48611 | It briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest - -- audience sadism -- is evaded completely .
185263 | 0.18056 | It could have been something special , but two things drag it down to mediocrity -- director Clare Peploe 's misunderstanding of Marivaux 's rhythms , and Mira Sorvino 's limitations as a classical actress .
185264 | 0.25 | It dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum .
185269 | 0.027778 | It desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time .
185271 | 0.26389 | It does n't offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is , or even its attitude toward its subject .
185273 | 0.16667 | It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a Mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that .
185274 | 0.26389 | It drowns in sap .
185275 | 0.18056 | It ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors .
185276 | 0.22222 | It feels like very light Errol Morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs .
185281 | 0.25 | It follows the Blair Witch formula for an hour , in which we 're told something creepy and vague is in the works , and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes .
185283 | 0.13889 | It goes on for too long and bogs down in a surfeit of characters and unnecessary subplots .
185284 | 0.375 | It has become apparent that the franchise 's best years are long past .
185285 | 0.29167 | It has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie , which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline .
185287 | 0.23611 | It has the air of a surprisingly juvenile lark , a pop-influenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent and wear thin with repetition .
185288 | 0.26389 | It has the requisite faux-urban vibe and hotter-two-years-ago rap and R&B names and references .
185293 | 0.5 | It has the right approach and the right opening premise , but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material .
185294 | 0.38889 | It is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment .
185295 | 0.125 | It is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously .
185296 | 0.083333 | It is depressing , ruthlessly pained and depraved , the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound .
185298 | 0.5 | It is one more celluloid testimonial to the cruelties experienced by Southern blacks as distilled through a Caucasian perspective .
185299 | 0.29167 | It is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill
185300 | 0.40278 | It is so earnest , so overwrought and so wildly implausible that it begs to be parodied .
185304 | 0.31944 | It just goes to show , an intelligent person is n't necessarily an admirable storyteller .
185310 | 0.33333 | It looks good , but it is essentially empty .
185311 | 0.43056 | It looks much more like a cartoon in the end than The Simpsons ever has .
185312 | 0.27778 | It made me realize that we really have n't had a good cheesy B-movie playing in theaters since ... well ... since last week 's Reign of Fire .
185313 | 0.125 | It makes even Elizabeth Hurley seem graceless and ugly .
185318 | 0.23611 | It merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them .
185323 | 0.125 | It might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the Saturday morning cartoons -- a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness .
185327 | 0.33333 | It never rises to its clever what-if concept .
185334 | 0.33333 | It reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it .
185339 | 0.47222 | It shares the first two films ' loose-jointed structure , but laugh-out-loud bits are few and far between .
185340 | 0.19444 | It should be doing a lot of things , but does n't .
185346 | 0.20833 | It should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring .
185351 | 0.375 | It sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that 's more or less how it plays out .
185352 | 0.29167 | It stars schticky Chris Rock and stolid Anthony Hopkins , who seem barely in the same movie .
185364 | 0.43056 | It tells its story in a flat manner and leaves you with the impression that you should have gotten more out of it than you did .
185366 | 0.45833 | It was a dark and stormy night ...
185367 | 0.25 | It would n't matter so much that this arrogant Richard Pryor wannabe 's routine is offensive , puerile and unimaginatively foul-mouthed if it was at least funny .
185378 | 0.33333 | Its and pieces of The Hot Chick are so hilarious , and Schneider 's performance is so fine , it 's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in The Animal -- is a slapdash mess .
185380 | 0.29167 | Its appeal will probably limited to LDS Church members and undemanding armchair tourists .
185383 | 0.27778 | Its audacious ambitions sabotaged by pomposity , Steven Soderbergh 's space opera emerges as a numbingly dull experience .
185386 | 0.30556 | Its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie 's presentation , which is way too stagy .
185390 | 0.33333 | Its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche .
185393 | 0.5 | Its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up .
185395 | 0.36111 | Its message has merit and , in the hands of a brutally honest individual like Prophet Jack , might have made a point or two regarding life .
185401 | 0.36111 | Its premise is smart , but the execution is pretty weary .
185403 | 0.375 | Its screenplay serves as auto-critique , and its clumsiness as its own most damning censure .
185409 | 0.23611 | Its simplicity puts an exclamation point on the fact that this is n't something to be taken seriously , but it also wrecks any chance of the movie rising above similar fare .
185454 | 0.23611 | Jaw-droppingly superficial , straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as John Ritter 's glory days on Three 's Company .
185517 | 0.22222 | Julie Davis is the Kathie Lee Gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego does n't always go hand in hand with talent .
185536 | 0.19444 | Just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that 's neither original nor terribly funny .
185539 | 0.27778 | Just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another , making Ararat far more demanding than it needs to be .
185543 | 0.29167 | Just consider what New Best Friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay .
185545 | 0.15278 | Just dreadful .
185551 | 0.26389 | Just is n't as weird as it ought to be .
185555 | 0.30556 | Just the sort of lazy tearjerker that gives movies about ordinary folk a bad name .
185573 | 0.30556 | Kapur weighs down the tale with bogus profundities .
185584 | 0.22222 | Kaufman 's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious .
185605 | 0.22222 | Kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper .
185625 | 0.19444 | Kitschy , flashy , overlong soap opera .
185629 | 0.22222 | Knockaround Guys plays like a student film by two guys who desperately want to be Quentin Tarantino when they grow up .
185638 | 0.16667 | Koepp 's screenplay is n't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own .
185644 | 0.19444 | Kung Pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after Oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party .
185647 | 0.30556 | Kurys seems intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business .
185661 | 0.20833 | Lacks dramatic punch and depth .
185668 | 0.18056 | Lacks the spirit of the previous two , and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck .
185670 | 0.29167 | Lacks the visual flair and bouncing bravado that characterizes better hip-hop clips and is content to recycle images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago .
185704 | 0.31944 | Lazily directed by Charles Stone III ... from a leaden script by Matthew Cirulnick and novelist Thulani Davis .
185707 | 0.11111 | Lazy filmmaking , with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it 's compelling .
185710 | 0.27778 | Leaks treacle from every pore .
185717 | 0.31944 | Leaves viewers out in the cold and undermines some phenomenal performances .
185732 | 0.44444 | Less a heartfelt appeal for the handicapped than a nice Belgian waffle .
185736 | 0.48611 | Less about Shakespeare than the spawn of fools who saw Quentin Tarantino 's handful of raucous gangster films and branched out into their own pseudo-witty copycat interpretations .
185741 | 0.18056 | Less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is .
185745 | 0.44444 | Let 's face it -- there are n't many reasons anyone would want to see Crossroads if they 're not big fans of teen pop kitten Britney Spears .
185753 | 0.25 | Like Mike is a slight and uninventive movie : Like the exalted Michael Jordan referred to in the title , many can aspire but none can equal .
185755 | 0.27778 | Like Showgirls and Glitter , the most entertaining moments here are unintentional .
185757 | 0.18056 | Like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they 're struggling to create .
185759 | 0.23611 | Like a comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop , Comedian runs out of steam after a half hour .
185761 | 0.26389 | Like a fish that 's lived too long , Austin Powers in Goldmember has some unnecessary parts and is kinda wrong in places .
185763 | 0.27778 | Like a grinning Jack O ' Lantern , its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy , having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded .
185765 | 0.31944 | Like a medium-grade network sitcom -- mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen .
185767 | 0.20833 | Like a three-ring circus , there are side stories aplenty -- none of them memorable .
185769 | 0.30556 | Like an Afterschool Special with costumes by Gianni Versace , Mad Love looks better than it feels .
185777 | 0.23611 | Like its script , which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire Olympic swim team through , the characters in Swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , brain-deadening hangover .
185778 | 0.25 | Like its title character , Esther Kahn is unusual but unfortunately also irritating .
185780 | 0.375 | Like leafing through an album of photos accompanied by the sketchiest of captions .
185782 | 0.19444 | Like life on the island , the movie grows boring despite the scenery .
185784 | 0.18056 | Like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories .
185786 | 0.31944 | Like most movies about the pitfalls of bad behavior ... Circuit gets drawn into the party .
185792 | 0.33333 | Like most of Jaglom 's films , some of it is honestly affecting , but more of it seems contrived and secondhand .
185794 | 0.40278 | Like shave ice without the topping , this cinematic snow cone is as innocuous as it is flavorless .
185796 | 0.15278 | Like the Tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on
185800 | 0.27778 | Like the world of his film , Hartley created a monster but did n't know how to handle it .
185815 | 0.27778 | Limps along on a squirm-inducing fish-out-of-water formula that goes nowhere and goes there very , very slowly .
185836 | 0.20833 | Lisa Rinzler 's cinematography may be lovely , but Love Liza 's tale itself virtually collapses into an inhalant blackout , maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension .
185839 | 0.38889 | Little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point ... is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable .
185841 | 0.45833 | Little more than a super-sized infomercial for the cable-sports channel and its Summer X Games .
185843 | 0.33333 | Little more than a well-mounted history lesson .
185857 | 0.16667 | Long before it 's over , you 'll be thinking of 51 ways to leave this loser .
185860 | 0.33333 | Long on twinkly-eyed close-ups and short on shame .
185870 | 0.16667 | Loosely speaking , we 're in All of Me territory again , and , strictly speaking , Schneider is no Steve Martin .
185876 | 0.18056 | Loud , chaotic and largely unfunny .

185893 | 0.36111 | Low comedy does n't come much lower .

185952 | 0.19444 | Maid in Manhattan proves that it 's easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies .

186032 | 0.13889 | Master of Disguise runs for only 71 minutes and feels like three hours .
186036 | 0.26389 | Mattei so completely loses himself to the film 's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , Love in the Time of Money .
186043 | 0.26389 | May offend viewers not amused by the sick sense of humor .
186044 | 0.27778 | May puzzle his most ardent fans .

186058 | 0.16667 | McKay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative .
186064 | 0.20833 | McTiernan 's remake may be lighter on its feet -- the sober-minded original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino -- but it is just as boring and as obvious .
186069 | 0.47222 | Meandering and glacially paced , and often just plain dull .
186088 | 0.22222 | Memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and , by extension , its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual .
186097 | 0.40278 | Merchant has n't directed this movie so much as produced it -- like sausage .

186189 | 0.16667 | Most of the dialogue made me want to pack raw dough in my ears .
186191 | 0.5 | Most of the film feels conceived and shot on the fly -- like between lunch breaks for Shearer 's radio show and his Simpson voice-overs .
186197 | 0.27778 | Most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and , no matter how Broomfield dresses it up , it tends to speculation , conspiracy theories or , at best , circumstantial evidence .

186200 | 0.25 | Mostly , Shafer and co-writer Gregory Hinton lack a strong-minded viewpoint , or a sense of humor .
186201 | 0.5 | Mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic : two parts exhausting Men in Black mayhem to one part family values .
186231 | 0.20833 | Much like Robin Williams , Death to Smoochy has already reached its expiration date .
186236 | 0.125 | Muddled , melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for Kevin Costner .

186252 | 0.33333 | Murphy and Wilson actually make a pretty good team ... but the project surrounding them is distressingly rote .
186266 | 0.34722 | My advice is to skip the film and pick up the soundtrack .
186274 | 0.13889 | Nair just does n't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy .
186276 | 0.48611 | Narc can only remind us of brilliant crime dramas without becoming one itself .

186286 | 0.11111 | Nearly every attempt at humor here is DOA .

188879 | 0.40278 | There are many things that solid acting can do for a movie , but crafting something promising from a mediocre screenplay is not one of them .
188881 | 0.47222 | There are more shots of children smiling for the camera than typical documentary footage which hurts the overall impact of the film .
188888 | 0.27778 | There are some laughs in this movie , but Williams ' anarchy gets tiresome , the satire is weak .

188923 | 0.30556 | They just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way .
188928 | 0.375 | They presume their audience wo n't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes .

188986 | 0.22222 | This is a movie that starts out like Heathers , then becomes Bring it On , then becomes unwatchable .
188990 | 0.40278 | This is a picture that Maik , the firebrand turned savvy ad man , would be envious of : it hijacks the heat of revolution and turns it into a sales tool .
188991 | 0.33333 | This is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like Them !
188992 | 0.33333 | This is a third-person story now , told by Hollywood , and much more ordinary for it .

188995 | 0.29167 | This is an exercise not in biography but in hero worship .

189378 | 0.27778 | Upper West Sidey exercise in narcissism and self-congratulation disguised as a tribute .

189487 | 0.34722 | We get the comedy we settle for .
189489 | 0.30556 | We have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat .
189494 | 0.27778 | We never feel anything for these characters , and as a result the film is basically just a curiosity .

189543 | 0.055556 | What 's most offensive is n't the waste of a good cast , but the film 's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism .

224009 | 0.055556 | In addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , Ballistic : Ecks Vs. Sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase .

224115 | 0.11111 | It 's a bad sign when you 're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects ' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it 's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .
224121 | 0.5 | It 's a feature-length adaptation of one of those `` Can This Marriage Be Saved ? ''
224126 | 0.25 | It 's a movie that ends with Truckzilla , for cryin ' out loud .
224131 | 0.45833 | It 's a scathing portrayal .
224135 | 0.16667 | It 's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish .
224143 | 0.18056 | It 's a visual Rorschach test and I must have failed .
224150 | 0.19444 | It 's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are ` edgy . '
224151 | 0.20833 | It 's also stupider .
224153 | 0.13889 | It 's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic .
224161 | 0.48611 | It 's another retelling of Alexandre Dumas ' classic .
224163 | 0.20833 | It 's as if Solondz had two ideas for two movies , could n't really figure out how to flesh either out , so he just slopped ` em together here .

224232 | 0.38889 | It 's plotless , shapeless -- and yet , it must be admitted , not entirely humorless .
224235 | 0.25 | It 's rare to see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from `` promising '' to `` interesting '' to `` familiar '' before landing squarely on `` stupid '' .
224237 | 0.13889 | It 's slow -- very , very slow .
224244 | 0.45833 | It 's still Adam Sandler , and it 's not Little Nicky .

224282 | 0.15278 | It does n't believe in itself , it has no sense of humor ... it 's just plain bored .
224290 | 0.25 | It does n't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events .
224298 | 0.44444 | It follows the basic plot trajectory of nearly every Schwarzenegger film : Someone crosses Arnie .
224301 | 0.33333 | It forces you to watch people doing unpleasant things to each other and themselves , and it maintains a cool distance from its material that is deliberately unsettling .
224302 | 0.20833 | It gets old quickly .
224305 | 0.34722 | It gives poor Dana Carvey nothing to do that is really funny , and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time .
224312 | 0.25 | It has no affect on the Kurds , but it wore me down .
224321 | 0.22222 | It irritates and saddens me that Martin Lawrence 's latest vehicle can explode obnoxiously into 2,500 screens while something of Bubba Ho-Tep 's clearly evident quality may end up languishing on a shelf somewhere .

224344 | 0.43056 | It just does n't have much else ... especially in a moral sense .
224345 | 0.34722 | It labours as storytelling .
224357 | 0.11111 | It made me feel unclean , and I 'm the guy who liked There 's Something About Mary and both American Pie movies .

224382 | 0.44444 | It never is , not fully .
224383 | 0.22222 | It never plays as dramatic even when dramatic things happen to people .
224384 | 0.29167 | It plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its `` dead wife communicating from beyond the grave '' framework is even remotely new or interesting .
224385 | 0.5 | It provides a grim , upsetting glimpse at the lives of some of the 1.2 million Palestinians who live in the crowded cities and refugee camps of Gaza .
224391 | 0.22222 | It squanders Chan 's uniqueness ; it could even be said to squander Jennifer Love Hewitt !

224394 | 0.26389 | It takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what TUCK EVERLASTING is about .
224397 | 0.38889 | It wears its heart on the sleeve of its gaudy Hawaiian shirt .
224403 | 0.5 | It wo n't rock any boats but is solid meat-and-potatoes filmmaking .
224408 | 0.44444 | It would be disingenuous to call Reno a great film , but you can say that about most of the flicks moving in and out of the multiplex .
224409 | 0.13889 | It would n't be my preferred way of spending 100 minutes or $ 7.00 .
224411 | 0.38889 | Its gross-out gags and colorful set pieces ... are of course stultifyingly contrived and too stylized by half .
224414 | 0.23611 | Its mysteries are transparently obvious , and it 's too slowly paced to be a thriller .
224418 | 0.29167 | Its one-sidedness ... flirts with propaganda .

226239 | 0.18056 | The ending is a cop-out .
226240 | 0.069444 | The entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another .
226242 | 0.26389 | The fact that it is n't very good is almost beside the point .
226247 | 0.48611 | The faithful will enjoy this sometimes wry adaptation of V.S. Naipaul 's novel , but newcomers may find themselves stifling a yawn or two during the first hour .
226253 | 0.16667 | The film 's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency .
226256 | 0.16667 | The film 's lack of personality permeates all its aspects -- from the TV movie-esque , affected child acting to the dullest Irish pub scenes ever filmed .
226257 | 0.30556 | The film 's most improbable feat ?
226258 | 0.31944 | The film 's needlessly opaque intro takes its doe-eyed Crudup out of pre-9 \/ 11 New York and onto a cross-country road trip of the Homeric kind .
226264 | 0.27778 | The film did n't convince me that Calvin Jr. 's Barbershop represents some sort of beacon of hope in the middle of Chicago 's South Side .
226270 | 0.27778 | The film is an earnest try at beachcombing verismo , but it would be even more indistinct than it is were it not for the striking , quietly vulnerable personality of Ms. Ambrose .
226271 | 0.5 | The film is directed by Wally Wolodarsky from a script by Joe Jarvis and Greg Coolidge .
226281 | 0.13889 | The film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in Chinese history : war , revolution , Communism , etc. .
226283 | 0.26389 | The film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip .
226284 | 0.15278 | The film would work much better as a video installation in a museum , where viewers would be free to leave .
226286 | 0.25 | The filmmakers are playing to the Big Boys in New York and L.A. To that end , they mock the kind of folks they do n't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers do n't care to understand , either .
226287 | 0.15278 | The first Fatal Attraction was vile enough .
226290 | 0.27778 | The first question to ask about Bad Company is why Anthony Hopkins is in it .
226306 | 0.20833 | The holiday message of the 37-minute Santa vs. the Snowman leaves a lot to be desired .
226309 | 0.22222 | The images lack contrast , are murky and are frequently too dark to be decipherable .
226312 | 0.125 | The innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen .
226325 | 0.47222 | The main problem being that it 's only a peek .
226326 | 0.19444 | The makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep .
226327 | 0.33333 | The mantra behind the project seems to have been ` it 's just a kids ' flick . '
226335 | 0.19444 | The most horrific movie experience I 've had since `` Ca n't Stop The Music . ''
226337 | 0.13889 | The most memorable moment was when Green threw medical equipment at a window ; not because it was particularly funny , but because I had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle 's walker and toss it at the screen in frustration .
226342 | 0.20833 | The movie 's downfall is to substitute plot for personality .
226351 | 0.34722 | The movie 's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story .
226361 | 0.013889 | The movie is a dud .
226362 | 0.33333 | The movie is about as deep as that sentiment .
226366 | 0.375 | The movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the `` webcast . ''
226370 | 0.43056 | The movie is n't horrible , but you can see mediocre cresting on the next wave .
226371 | 0.43056 | The movie is obviously a labour of love so Howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted .
226372 | 0.15278 | The movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical .
226378 | 0.33333 | The movie is without intent .
226379 | 0.18056 | The movie makes absolutely no sense .
226380 | 0.47222 | The movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as Jules Verne 's ' 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea ' and the George Pal version of H.G. Wells ' ` The Time Machine . '
226382 | 0.44444 | The movie occasionally threatens to become didactic , but it 's too grounded in the reality of its characters to go over the edge .
226383 | 0.30556 | The movie would seem less of a trifle if Ms. Sugarman followed through on her defiance of the saccharine .
226384 | 0.44444 | The name says it all .
226387 | 0.125 | The only entertainment you 'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair will be from unintentional giggles -- several of them .
226389 | 0.30556 | The only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game .
226391 | 0.38889 | The only pain you 'll feel as the credits roll is your stomach grumbling for some tasty grub .
226392 | 0.38889 | The only question ... is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering .
226394 | 0.125 | The only thing `` swept away '' is the one hour and thirty-three minutes spent watching this waste of time .
226396 | 0.041667 | The only thing to fear about `` Fear Dot Com '' is hitting your head on the theater seat in front of you when you doze off thirty minutes into the film .
226409 | 0.27778 | The overall feel is not unlike watching a glorified episode of `` 7th Heaven . ''
226414 | 0.11111 | The performances are so overstated , the effect comes off as self-parody .
226416 | 0.27778 | The period -- swinging London in the time of the mods and the rockers -- gets the once-over once again in Gangster No. 1 , but falls apart long before the end .
226422 | 0.47222 | The photographer 's show-don ` t-tell stance is admirable , but it can make him a problematic documentary subject .
226435 | 0.40278 | The power of this script , and the performances that come with it , is that the whole damned thing did n't get our moral hackles up .
226436 | 0.16667 | The premise itself is just SOOOOO tired .
226442 | 0.23611 | The premise of `` Abandon '' holds promise , ... but its delivery is a complete mess .
226443 | 0.22222 | The problem , it is with most of these things , is the script .
226444 | 0.44444 | The problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , Mr. Desplechin is content to state it .
226445 | 0.19444 | The problem is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage .
226447 | 0.23611 | The problem with `` XXX '' is that its own action is n't very effective .
226448 | 0.22222 | The problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one , there 's no saving the movie .
226449 | 0.36111 | The problem with movies about angels is they have a tendency to slip into hokum .
226451 | 0.26389 | The problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of Auschwitz II-Birkenau .
226452 | 0.29167 | The problem with this film is that it lacks focus .
226454 | 0.48611 | The problems of the people in Love in the Time of Money are hardly specific to their era .
226456 | 0.5 | The question hanging over The Time Machine is not , as the main character suggests , ` what if ? '
226457 | 0.41667 | The real question this movie poses is not ` Who ? '
226458 | 0.20833 | The reality of the new live-action Pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque .
226461 | 0.125 | The rest of the film ... is dudsville .
226469 | 0.20833 | The screenplay does too much meandering , Norton has to recite bland police procedural details , Fiennes wanders around in an attempt to seem weird and distanced , Hopkins looks like a drag queen .
226472 | 0.33333 | The screenwriters dig themselves in deeper every time they toss logic and science into what is essentially a `` Dungeons and Dragons '' fantasy with modern military weaponry ...
226473 | 0.36111 | The script ?
226475 | 0.22222 | The script by Vincent R. Nebrida ... tries to cram too many ingredients into one small pot .
226477 | 0.38889 | The script kicks in , and Mr. Hartley 's distended pace and foot-dragging rhythms follow .
226480 | 0.41667 | The setting is so cool that it chills the characters , reducing our emotional stake in the outcome of `` Intacto 's '' dangerous and seductively stylish game .
226482 | 0.22222 | The skills of a calculus major at M.I.T. are required to balance all the formulaic equations in the long-winded heist comedy Who Is Cletis Tout ?
226483 | 0.5 | The sound of GUNFIRE and cell phones RINGING .
226486 | 0.22222 | The star who helped give a spark to `` Chasing Amy '' and `` Changing Lanes '' falls flat as thinking man CIA agent Jack Ryan in this summer 's new action film , `` The Sum of All Fears . ''
226487 | 0.055556 | The story 's pathetic and the gags are puerile . .
226497 | 0.44444 | The story is less vibrant , the jokes are a little lukewarm , but will anyone really care ?
226498 | 0.11111 | The story loses its bite in a last-minute happy ending that 's even less plausible than the rest of the picture .
226499 | 0.30556 | The story passes time until it 's time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge .
226506 | 0.22222 | The story really has no place to go since Simone is not real -- she ca n't provide any conflict .
226512 | 0.38889 | The thing about guys like Evans is this : You 're never quite sure where self-promotion ends and the truth begins .
226534 | 0.27778 | The vampire thriller Blade II starts off as a wild hoot and then sucks the blood out of its fun -- toward the end , you can feel your veins cringing from the workout .
226537 | 0.25 | The very definition of what critics have come to term an `` ambitious failure . ''
226538 | 0.40278 | The vintage is pure ' 87 , with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message : Fatal Attraction = do n't have an affair with a nutjob ; Unfaithful = do n't if you 're married to one .
226544 | 0.16667 | The whole film has this sneaky feel to it -- as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as Very Important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a Hollywood product .
226545 | 0.055556 | The whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it 's trying to set the women 's liberation movement back 20 years . '
226554 | 0.29167 | Their contrast is neither dramatic nor comic -- it 's just a weird fizzle .
226555 | 0.34722 | Their film falters , however , in its adherence to the Disney philosophy of required poignancy , a salute that I 'd hoped the movie would avoid .
226557 | 0.11111 | Then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed .
226559 | 0.27778 | Then you get another phone call warning you that if the video is n't back at Blockbuster before midnight , you 're going to face frightening late fees .

226569 | 0.16667 | There 's no energy .
226574 | 0.33333 | There are just too many characters saying too many clever things and getting into too many pointless situations .
226583 | 0.16667 | There are now two signs that M. Night Shyamalan 's debut feature sucked up all he has to give to the mystic genres of cinema : Unbreakable and Signs .
226590 | 0.44444 | There can be no other explanation .
226591 | 0.5 | There has to be a few advantages to never growing old .

226622 | 0.13889 | This 90-minute dud could pass for Mike Tyson 's E !
226624 | 0.22222 | This New Zealand coming-of-age movie is n't really about anything .
226625 | 0.33333 | This Sade is hardly a perverse , dangerous libertine and agitator -- which would have made for better drama .
226636 | 0.45833 | This film , starring Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock , is your typical ` fish out of water ' story .
226638 | 0.33333 | This film biggest problem ?
226641 | 0.20833 | This insufferable movie is meant to make you think about existential suffering .
226645 | 0.26389 | This is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout .
226654 | 0.055556 | This is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer .
226659 | 0.16667 | This is just lazy writing .

226673 | 0.069444 | This is one of the biggest disappointments of the year .
226682 | 0.30556 | This mild-mannered farce , directed by one of its writers , John C. Walsh , is corny in a way that bespeaks an expiration date passed a long time ago .

226686 | 0.29167 | This movie seems to have been written using Mad-libs .

226698 | 0.16667 | This pathetic junk is barely an hour long .
226703 | 0.15278 | This self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy Stealing Harvard , but he 's the most obvious one .
226705 | 0.25 | This starts off with a 1950 's Doris Day feel and it gets very ugly , very fast .
226711 | 0.36111 | This time Mr. Burns is trying something in the Martin Scorsese street-realist mode , but his self-regarding sentimentality trips him up again .
226713 | 0.5 | This version of H.G. Wells ' Time Machine was directed by H.G. Wells ' great-grandson .

226735 | 0.20833 | Though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed ... that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like Mr. Schepisi 's seems skimpy and unclear .
